<h1>In short</h1>
<p><strong>You can contribute:</strong> We are an open community that empowers progressive activists all over the world. Your knowledge and experiences are valuable to millions of fellow world-changers. Anyone can contribute to the Activist Handbook, you too!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learn from others:</strong> On our site we have guides on how to grow your movement, make a successful petition and organise a protest. All knowledge is complemented by personal experiences of activists. Information is adapted to your local context. And if some content is missing, you can add it yourself to help others.</p>
<p><strong>For activists, by activists:</strong> Activist Handbook was made during a two-day hackathon by young activists from all across Europe. It is an open source, free to use, platform.</p>
