<p style="text-align:justify;">The Activist Handbook was created by six activists from various countries in Europe during the FYEG Summercamp Hackathon 2019 in Serbia. We wanted to create a guidebook for fellow activists that would empower them to fight for change.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Summer Hackathon was organised by the Green European Foundation with the support of the FYEG and with the financial support of the European Parliament to the GEF. The Summer Camp was supported by the European Youth Foundation of the Council of Europe.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Co-founders:</strong></i><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sean.currie.77736">Sean Currie</a><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/niks.derums.7">Niks Derums</a><br><a href="https://joppehoekstra.nl">Joppe Hoekstra</a><br><a href="https://www.greenparty.ie/people/daniel-whooley/">Daniel Whooley</a><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/elizabete.vegnere.5">Elizabete Vegnere</a><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013130268740">Marijn Prins</a></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>The FYEG Summercamp Hackathon was supported by:</strong></i><br>Federation of Young European Greens<br>Green European Foundation<br>European Youth Foundation<br>Council of Europe</p><h1 style="text-align:justify;">Principles</h1><p>We want to encourage people of all backgrounds to unite and stand up for justice.
