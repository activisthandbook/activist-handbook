<p>As an activist, knowing your rights is an enormously powerful tool to have when dealing with authorities. "Rights" is here understood as <i>legal </i>rights, rather than any moral, philosophical or religious rights. Use this knowledge to protect yourself, to organise actions, or to outwit heavy-handed police officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rights that you have within your country are also influenced by international rights which apply to <strong>everyone</strong>. Check out the sections below.</p>
