That is why we encourage people of all genders, sexual preferences and ethnic backgrounds, including people with disabilities, to join our cause.</p><h1>We meet online</h1><p>We're activists from all over the world, so we cannot regularly meet face to face. Instead, we regularly have video calls. Are you new with Activist Handbook? We would very much like to get to know you during our next call! We also have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/activisthandbook/">Facebook group </a>in which activists can exchange experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
