<h2>What is it and does it matter?</h2>
<p>Confusingly, the International Bill of Human Rights is actually not a bill at all, but includes a resolution and two treaties: the <a href="/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), the <a href="/en/International-Covenant-on-Civil-and-Political-Rights">International Covenant on on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The first two are super relevant to activists but the last one is not, so we won't talk about it. Since it is not a bill,<strong> the ‘Bill’ is</strong> <strong>not legally binding</strong>. However, this doesn't mean that it's unimportant.</p>
<p>From a legal perspective, states have to provide a way for you to address violations of the ICCPR. This means that if you believe an authority has violated this part of the International Bill of Human Rights, you can hold them accountable for this. Of course, states don’t always follow this obligation, and the documents contain a number of exeptions such as “public emergency” that allow states to break these rules. But international human rights law undoubtedly influences national law, and is a useful weapon for you to empower yourself with.</p>
