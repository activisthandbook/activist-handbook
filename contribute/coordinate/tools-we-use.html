<p><strong>On this page we provide an overview of all the tools that our coordination team uses. If you need any help getting them to work, do not hesitate to schedule a video call with one of your fellow coordinators.</strong></p>
<h1>Slack</h1>
<p>Our most important platform to communicate is Slack. As a coordinator, you will be added to the closed channel #team-coordinators. You will be able to see all messages that coordinators have sent before.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Google Workspace</h1>
<p>The easiest way to get started with our Google Workspace is to <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">add our account to your Google Chrome</a>. To receive the login details for our account, reach out to one of your fellow coordinators. We use two-step verification, so another member will always have to verify your login (a password alone is not enough).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>üîê IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:</strong> Please, do not save passwords of your personal accounts while logged in with the Activist Handbook account. That means that all of us could see your private login details!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are personally responsible for keeping your private data safe. Take that responsibility serious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use our paid Google Workspace plan for the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Calendar: </strong>We save all our events and team meetings in our shared calendar. A weekly overview of all events is automatically be sent in Slack.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Contacts:</strong> Anyone who has previously communicated with us via email or signed up via Mailchimp is automatically added to our contact list.</li>
  <li><strong>Gmail: </strong>Our emails address contact@activisthandbook.org is managed using gmail.</li>
  <li><strong>Chrome bookmarks: </strong>To help you find frequently used tools, we have added some useful links to our Chrome toolbar.</li>
  <li><strong>Password manager: </strong>All our account credentials are saved in our digital keychain.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Meet:</strong> For our video calls, we use Google Meet.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Mailchimp</h1>
<p>We use Mailchimp for our newsletter, signup pages and automated replies. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.</p>
<h1>Hootsuite</h1>
<p>We use Hootsuite to manage all our social media accounts more efficiently. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.</p>
<h1>Google Analytics</h1>
<p>We use Google Analytics to track which pages on our website are most frequently visited and how people find us.</p>
<h1>Zapier</h1>
<p>Various tools that we use are connected with each other using Zapier.</p>
