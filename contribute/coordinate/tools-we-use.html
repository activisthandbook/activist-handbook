<p><strong>On this page we provide an overview of all the digital tools that our coordination team uses.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Training &amp; support: </strong>Getting to know all of the tools that we use can be a bit overwhelming. That is why we like to schedule a video call so we can show you step by step how to use these tools. Don't hesitate to ask for help!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>List of tools</h1>
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>Our most important platform to communicate is Slack. As a coordinator, you will be added to the closed channel #team-coordinators. You will be able to see all messages that coordinators have sent before.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Google Workspace</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with our Google Workspace is to <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">add our account to your Google Chrome</a>. To receive the login details for our account, reach out to one of your fellow coordinators. We use two-step verification, so another member will always have to verify your login (a password alone is not enough).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>üîê IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:</strong> Please, do not save passwords of your personal accounts while logged in with the Activist Handbook account. That means that all of us could see your private login details!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are personally responsible for keeping your private data safe. Take that responsibility serious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use our paid Google Workspace plan for the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Calendar: </strong>We save all our events and team meetings in our shared calendar. A weekly overview of all events is automatically be sent in Slack.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Contacts:</strong> Anyone who has previously communicated with us via email or signed up via Mailchimp is automatically added to our contact list.</li>
  <li><strong>Gmail: </strong>Our emails address contact@activisthandbook.org is managed using gmail.</li>
  <li><strong>Chrome bookmarks: </strong>To help you find frequently used tools, we have added some useful links to our Chrome toolbar.</li>
  <li><strong>Password manager: </strong>All our account credentials are saved in our digital keychain.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Meet:</strong> For our video calls, we use Google Meet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pitch</h2>
<p>We use Pitch to create beautiful slide presentations. For example, our we use Pitch for our bi-weekly updates. You need to be added to our Pitch workspace before you can use it!</p>
<h2>Mailchimp</h2>
<p>We use Mailchimp for our newsletter, signup pages and automated replies. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.</p>
<h2>Hootsuite</h2>
<p>We use Hootsuite to manage all our social media accounts more efficiently. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.</p>
<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>We use Google Analytics to track which pages on our website are most frequently visited and how people find us.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Flow</h2>
<p>Various tools that we use are connected with each other using Microsoft Flow.</p>
