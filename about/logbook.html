<h1>Why do we keep a logbook?</h1>
<p>All Activist Handbook circles keep a logbook. We do this because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We work more effectively by remembering our previous actions.</li>
  <li>We want to be transparent about our decision making process.</li>
  <li>We want to make it easier for new members to join.</li>
  <li>We want to help fellow activists understand how to manage an organisation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What do we record?</h1>
<p>The following will be recorded by teams in our logbook:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone starts or stops as coordinator</li>
  <li>Meetings, with minutes and recordings attached</li>
  <li>Important decisions and actions</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
