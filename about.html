We wanted to create a guidebook for fellow activists that would empower them to fight for change.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Summer Hackathon was organised by the Green European Foundation with the support of the FYEG and with the financial support of the European Parliament to the GEF. The Summer Camp was supported by the European Youth Foundation of the Council of Europe.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><mark class="marker-yellow">Currently, we are growing our team of volunteers and developing our platform further.
