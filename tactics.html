<p>Here is a list of various tactics that activists use in their work. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to a cause in their own way.&nbsp;</p><p>The tactics are categorised to make it easier for you to find the right one, but tactics may actually fall under multiple categories at the same time or none at all.</p><p>Many of the tactics below require you to assemble many people. Make sure to check out our chapter about <a href="/collective-action"><strong>collective action</strong></a> to find out more about this topic.</p><p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>You can contribute: </strong>This handbook is written by people like you.
