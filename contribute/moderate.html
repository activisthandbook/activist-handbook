<p>Moderators uphold quality by proofreading, adding references and fixing vandalism. If you would like to help us uphold the quality of our content, make sure to <a href="/join">join our team</a>.</p>
<p>Ways in which you moderate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proofread new articles that our content team has written</li>
  <li><a href="https://forms.gle/G1Akz312fgW6Ud9D6">Report vandalism</a> to us or fix it yourself by using the version history.</li>
  <li>Check recently edited pages on our dashboard and review the changes that were made. You will need to <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">request the necessary permissions</a> first.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Transparency</h1>
<p>In principle, we allow anyone to contribute to our shared knowledge base on activism. However, everyone who wishes to do so, must follow <a href="/en/about/principles">our principles</a>.</p>
<p>Any changes made are saved forever. We do this to provide transparency about who has contributed to Activist Handbook.</p>
