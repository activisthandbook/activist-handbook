<p>Metadata is often described as everything <i>except</i> the content of your communications. You can think of metadata as the digital equivalent of an envelope. Just like an envelope contains information about the sender, receiver, and destination of a message, so does metadata. Metadata is information about the digital communications you send and receive. Some examples of metadata include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name and members of your group chats</li>
  <li>the length of your conversations</li>
  <li>the time frame in which a conversation took place</li>
  <li>your location when communicating (as well as with whom)</li>
</ul>
