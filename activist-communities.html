<p>Activist Handbook is a non-profit organisation developed by volunteers. We depend on donations to host our website.

<h1>Contact lists</h1>
<p>We have collected large lists of activist organisations in Europe that were publicly available on the internet (700+ email addresses). Because of privacy concerns, we cannot share these contact details on our website. However, in certain circumstances, we can share a portion of this database with you. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are organising a climate protest in a certain city and you would like to contact all climate activist related organisations in that particular city.</li>
  <li>You are a researcher looking into the kinds of social justice movements that exist in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">Contact us</a> to see if we can help you. We have contact details for (local departments of) the following organisations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Climate movements such as Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion</li>
  <li>European political (youth) organisations, such as FYEG and all its national and regional member organisations</li>
  <li>Various human rights, women's rights and social justice organisations</li>
</ul>
<h1>List of communities</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The list below is still quite short, but this might (hopefully) change in the future. We will need to start organising all activists movements on this website better. For example, we could make categories for "environmental movements" and a "LGBTQ+ movements".&nbsp;</p>
