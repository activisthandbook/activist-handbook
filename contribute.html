<p>Activist Handbook is written by activists like you. We are building this knowledge base together. You can start contributing too by <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/login"><strong>creating an account</strong></a>!</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="write"><strong>Write an article</strong></a>: Any contribution is valued, no matter how small. Create a completely new page, add some resources to a page, or correct a typo. Make sure to read our guidelines on how to write good articles!</li>
  <li><a href="translate"><strong>Translate a page</strong></a>: We want to make Activist Handbook accessible for everyone. That is why we have a team of translators who manage the localised versions of our platform.</li>
  <li><a href="moderate"><strong>Moderate contributions</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Every edit is saved forever. This makes it easier for us to moderate. You can view version history of pages on our website, as well as via our backup at <a href="https://github.com/activisthandbook/articles">GitHub</a>. If you see any vandalism, do not hesitate to contact us or to fix it yourself.</li>
  <li><a href="/en/about/developers"><strong>Become a developer</strong></a>: Activist Handbook is an open source project. We very much welcome you to contribute. We made a page for developers where we document how our platform was built.</li>
