<p>Feel free to add resources about activism on this page. Please make sure the resource follows the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The resource is about activism in general</strong>. If there is a page on this website that is more related, add it on that page. For example, a resource on how to organise a protest march fits better on the page about <a href="/tactics/march">protest marches</a>. This way it becomes easier to find the right resources. If you are unsure where to place a resource, add it to the comments!</li>
  <li><strong>Resources in other languages should be added to the resource pages of those languages, unless there are translations or subtitles available.</strong> If no resources page exists for your language yet, you can create it yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Summarise what the resource is about. </strong>Add (if applicable) the author, the year of publication, and a brief summary of the contents of the resource.</li>
  <li><strong>Whenever possible, link to the website of the original author, instead of websites like Amazon. </strong>We are not here to help these monopolists get better search engine results.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Read resources in other languages: <a href="/nl/resources">Nederlands</a> | Deutch | Fran√ßais</p>
