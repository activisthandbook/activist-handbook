<h1>Some tips &amp; tricks&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Keeping an overview</h2>
<p>With multiple people working on different aspects of the same project, it is important to have someone (or multiple people) that keep an overview.</p>
<h2><strong>Setting clear to-do's</strong></h2>
<p>Turn <i>“let's change the world”</i> into smaller and more manageable concrete steps. Make sure that it is clear who does what when. Constantly follow up on to-do's to see if things are going as planned, and then adapt accordingly.</p>
<h2><strong>Facilitating conversations</strong></h2>
<p>Having productive conversations that make all participants feel comfortable requires active facilitation, especially in online video calls. Read our guide on <a href="/contribute/coordinate/facilitate-meetings">how to facilitate meetings</a>.</p>
<h2>Taking care of wellbeing</h2>
<p>Working together on a project is not just about being as productive as possible. Make sure to continuously keep an eye out for people's mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
