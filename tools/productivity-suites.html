<p>Evaluation criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pricing</strong>: Is there a special plan for registered non-profits? Is it affordable for people who are not part of a registered organisation?</li>
  <li><strong>Open source &amp; self-hosted: </strong>Is the source code publicly available? Can the platform easily be set up for self-hosting? Relevant if you do not want to work with evil big business.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of use: </strong>How much training is required before people can use the tools?</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality: </strong>Are file storage, collaborative documents (text editor, presentations, spreadsheets), communication platform and video calls available?</li>
