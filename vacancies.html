<h1>What is Activist Handbook?</h1>
<p><strong>Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-like site for everyone to exchange knowledge and experiences on activism. It is build by people like you.</strong> We recognise the urgency of solving the climate crisis and bringing the growing wealth gap to a halt. Together we want to make change-making more effective, and we believe that we can only achieve this by empowering the powerless. We welcome you to join our team! Check out our current team of volunteers on our <a href="/en/about">about page</a>.</p>
