<h1>Ongoing</h1>

<h2>Project working docs</h2>
<p>Every project at Activist Handbook has a <i>project working doc</i>. In these documents you will find a project proposal and timeline that is constantly updated. Keep in mind that some are in pre-preparatory phase and are not guaranteed to be realised in the near future (in other words: be moved back to the ideas category).</p>
