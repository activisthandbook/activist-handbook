<p>The local context of your project, group, or organisation could be the whole context, or it could be just the local branch of a bigger group, organisation or movement.</p>
<p>Whether you are a self-contained local group or a local branch of a larger group, it can be useful to form partnerships with other activist groups in your local area.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEBqghzyEg/hvNAFVCJQlhcbYIXWWDJJg/view#1">This presentation</a> was made by the Extinction Rebellion (XR) Global's ‘Local Partnerships Support’ team before that team evolved into something else, but the presentation applies equally to any group, not just XR groups. Adapt it for your own use!</p>
