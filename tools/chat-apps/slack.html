<p>Slack is a team communication tool. That means it has slightly more robust features than a simple chat app, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading">threading</a> conversations or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room">channels</a> for specific topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slack is not open source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slack is not end to end encrypted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admins of a Slack could hypothetically read private messages between members of the Slack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free slack has a limited on how many messages it stores in it's history and it can have trouble scaling as the number of people using it grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But slack is also free, relatively generous and very familiar to many people so it has certain social advantages.&nbsp;</p>
