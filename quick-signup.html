<h1>We need to act now</h1>
<p>These are unprecedented times. Millions of species are going extinct. The very existence of the human race is at stake. Yet, our political leaders seem to prefer short term profits for the very few, over the wellbeing of planet earth and all its citizens.&nbsp;It is time to rebel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a Activist Handbook. We educate those who are brave enough to challenge the status quo. We believe thereâ€™s no one who can stop us, once we unite and act as one. <i>Sign up, and our international community of change-makers today:</i></p>
