<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>The International Bill of Human Rights was created by <a href="https://activisthandbook.org/en/united-nations">The United Nations</a> and has three parts. The International Bill of Human Rights has three parts: <a href="/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the <a href="/International-Covenant-on-Civil-and-Political-Rights">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. The first two are super relevant to activists but the last one is not, so we won't talk about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maybe even more relevant to our community is The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), signed in 1966. Finally, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not very relevant to activism and therefore we wonâ€™t talk about it here.</p>
<p>Confusingly, the International Bill of Human Rights is technically not a bill at all, but includes a resolution and two treaties. Therefore,<strong> the Bill is</strong> <strong>not legally binding</strong>. However, this does not mean it does not have influence.</p>
