<h2>Violence</h2>

<h1>Choosing your tactics</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>“In the world of give and take, tactics is the art of how to take and how to give… <strong>how the Have-nots can take power away from the Haves</strong>”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">- Saul Alinsky (Rules for Radicals, p.92)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>This section was based on the chapter 'Using your power' in </i><a href="https://advocatesforyouth.org/youth-activist-toolkit/"><i>Youth Activist Toolkit</i></a><i>, by Advocates for Youth (2019)</i></p>
<p>Here are some quick steps to help you decide what tactics to use:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make clear what change you would like to see. </strong>You are calling upon others to do something, so make sure they know what exactly you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Get the attention of your targets. </strong>Who are affected? Who might support your cause? Who has to power to decide on the issue?</li>
  <li><strong>Use your power and act collectively. </strong>Whatever you do, do it together with others. The harsh truth: you will probably not achieve your goal after a single action, so make sure to build your power every time.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow people to contribute in their own way. </strong>Enable supporters to contribute to your cause in whatever way they feel comfortable. You might be willing to chain yourself to a tree to save it, but others might prefer to organise a theatre play to create more awareness about the importance of not cutting trees.</li>

<h2>Saul Alinsky's 13 Rules</h2>
<p>One of the most influential books about organising is Saul Alinsky's <i>Rules for Radicals</i>, published in 1970. In it, Alinsky includes a chapter on tactics, which contains 13 rules for choosing your tactics.</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.” (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Never go outside the experience of your people." (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Wherever possible go outside of the experience of the enemy.” (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“A good tactic is one that your people enjoy” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>"“If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counter side; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>“The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” (p.130)</li>
  <li>"“Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” (p.130)</li>
