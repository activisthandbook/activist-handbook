<p><strong>In this guide, we explain when and how we meet. We highly recommend volunteers to subscribe to </strong><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y29udGFjdEBhY3RpdmlzdGhhbmRib29rLm9yZw"><strong>our Google Calendar</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h1>Schedule</h1>
<p>We follow a 4-week schedule, as outlined below. We encourage all volunteers to join our <i>General</i> and <i>Governance</i> meetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Circles other than the core circle may schedule their own meetings as well. Check the relevant Slack channels for the dates of those meetings.</p>

<h1>Virtual workspace</h1>
<p>Every day between 14:00 and 16:00 UTC we host a virtual workspace using a Discord audio channel. Our virtual workspace is open for all volunteers to join whenever they want to work on Activist Handbook.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can join our Discord using this <a href="https://discord.gg/MrVUZzEcw2">invite link</a>. Note that we first have to verify you before you can join any audio channel.</p>

<h1>Meeting formats</h1>
<p>Our meetings always follow a structured format. There are two formats that we use:</p>
<ul>
