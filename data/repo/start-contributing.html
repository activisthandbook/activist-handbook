Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones.</li><li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic. </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li><li><strong>Make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li><li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you.</li><li><strong>Use titles to structure your article.</strong> Use short instead of long titles.</li></ul>
