<p>Styling and formatting text in articles works just like in text processors such as Word, Pages or Google Docs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To learn what all buttons do, hover over them. </strong>A small tooltip will appear below to tell you what its function is.</p>

<h1>Creating headings</h1>
<p>To organise text in headings, use the button all the way to the left of the menu bar saying 'Paragraph'. Large headings have small numbers, small headings have large numbers. Always start with Heading 1 and use Heading 2 to create subheadings, Heading 3 to create sub-subheadings, and so forth.</p>
<h1>Adding a quote block</h1>
<p>To create a quote block, use the button with the quotation mark: <strong>"</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a quote block!</p>
</blockquote>
