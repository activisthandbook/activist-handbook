<p><strong>In this guide, we will help you to get started as a project coordinator. We encourage you to to keep this document up-to-date. This will help you and your successor! Also make sure to check out the </strong><a href="/en/contribute/coordinate"><strong>other guides for coordinators</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h1>Role definition</h1>
<p>The purpose, domain and accountabilities of this role can be found <a href="https://airtable.com/shrgU5rF75woG9SHq/tbloV4g8loVisebVz/viwwMs1CKcvYURh2R/recKx1fPlHsMAnvwq"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<h1>The basics</h1>
<h2>1. Be flexible and proactive</h2>
<p>The role of project coordinator is different than most other roles: your accountabilities will vary over time, depending on who needs your help most.</p>
<p>This means that you will have to be flexible: sometimes you have to be proactive and take the initiative, other times, circles will benefit more if you step aside and give them more autonomy.</p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> your job to do everything others fail to do. Instead, you role is to help others to come to their full potential. Only if you think that <strong>temporarily</strong> taking over some responsibilities will make circles more autonomous in the long run, you should do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We mostly work with inexperienced volunteers. We try to help them as much as possible using guides and video calls for new members. However, there will always be unexpected difficulties. As project facilitator, it is your job to spot these gaps and provide solutions that prevent these things from happening in the future.</p>
<h2>2. Determine who needs your help</h2>
<p>One of the most important tasks of the project coordinator is to keep an overview of what is happening between various circles. In the following cases, your help is needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A role is not/insufficiently reporting back to the core circle. </strong>All circle coordinators are responsible for reporting back to the core circle (and all circle members to their respective coordinator). Without updates, you and other circles cannot properly do their job. If they fail to do so, you need to step in.</li>
  <li><strong>A circle or core circle member is having difficulties. </strong>If you notice a circle or role is inactive, not delivering on promises or struggling to fulfil their purpose, it is your time to step in. In some cases, a role or circle will bring up these difficulties themselves. In other cases (like described in the point before), you need to identify the problems yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent difficulties to arise in the first place, make sure to offer your support in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A new project is being started. </strong>Do not expect everyone to be a professional project manager straight away. Take a proactive role to see if they need any help getting started. With more experienced volunteers, you can take a more relaxed approach.</li>
  <li><strong>New core circle members: </strong>In the first months, regularly check in with new core circle members to see if they need any help.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Identify problems &amp; offer support</strong></h2>
<p>If you know a circle is in need of help, take a proactive role. Join their circle meetings and Slack channels and analyse what is the root cause of their difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Propose changes that you think will address their difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
