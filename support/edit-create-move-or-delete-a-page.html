<p>Pages on Activist Handbook are organised in folders. They can only exist in one place at the same time. However, it is possible to create a redirect link.</p>
<p>Here is how to change the page url or put the page in a different folder: First, open the page you would like to move. Then click the blue <strong>Edit</strong> button in the bottom right corner. On the top right, click the <strong>Page</strong> button with the blue label icon. This will open up a window where you can change various page properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To edit the page url, change the <strong>Path </strong>field. Remember: paths should not contain any special characters such as "!@#%" or spaces. Alternatively, you can also click the <strong>Folder </strong>button with the looking glass, to browse and select a folder. Do not forget to close the window by clicking <strong>Ok</strong> and then the <strong>Save</strong> button with the green checkmark in the top right corner.</p>
