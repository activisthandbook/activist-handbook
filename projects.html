<p><strong>On this page, you will find all projects that Activist Handbook is currently working on, has done in the past, or might do in the future.</strong></p>

<h1>Ongoing</h1>
<h2>Highlighted pages</h2>
<p>Here you can find the individual pages of ongoing projects that will serve as an interactive online dashboard. You can follow the progress of projects by phases, see announcements for public events or other forms of contribution.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, there are no highlighted project pages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project working docs</h2>
<p>Every project at Activist Handbook has a <i>project working doc</i>. In these documents you will find a project proposal and timeline that is constantly updated. Keep in mind that some are in pre-preparatory phase and are not guaranteed to be realised in the near future (in other words: be moved back to the ideas category).</p>
