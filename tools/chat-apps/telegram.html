<p>Telegram is an open source messaging app. It's a chat app, but it also allows for massive communities. Some of the largest communities out there. 75k people per group.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Telegram offers great features for large movements. However, it one of the least secure and privacy friendly options out there. Also make sure to check out our <a href="/tools/chat-apps">reviews of other chats apps</a>.</p>

<p><br><br>Public channels are not end to end encrypted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private messages can be end to end encrypted though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telegram is useful if you want to keep a super large number of people informed on a subject in a semi public way with the option for secure private messaging.&nbsp;</p>
