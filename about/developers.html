<p>We like to be as transparent as possible about how we develop our platform, making it easier for activist developers to start contributing to our project. On this page we document what tools we use and why.</p><p><mark class="marker-yellow">We only recommend tools we actually use and like. Affiliation links are always clearly marked.</mark></p><h1>Open source</h1><p>All our work is freely accessible and reusable. We make sure that all our contributions are available under a free and open license. We have a <a href="https://github.com/activisthandbook">GitHub page</a> where we publish all our code and backup all contributions made on this website.</p><h1>Website</h1><h2>Wiki</h2><p>The Activist Handbook platform is running <a href="https://wiki.js.org">WikiJS</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hosting</h2><p>We bought our domain name at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>. Our website is hosted using a droplet by <a href="https://m.do.co/c/853123d09510">DigitalOcean</a> for $6 per month <i>(affiliate link: you get €100, we get €25)</i>. We use the free version of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> to protect our site.&nbsp;</p><h2>Backups</h2><p>A backup is made of our full server every week by Digital Ocean. We also keep a mirror of all articles on GitHub. Check out this <a href="https://docs.requarks.io/storage/git">guide</a> how to set up Git versioning in WikiJS.</p><h2>Analytics</h2><p>We're currently using Google Analytics to track the popularity of pages. We realise the privacy implications of using Google Analytics, so we are planning to start using a self-hosted Matomo instance soon in the future.</p><h1>Email</h1><p>We wanted an email setup that would cost as little as possible while still remaining reliable. Verification emails when signing up are send using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a>, for which we have a free limit of 62,000 emails per month with a rate of 14 emails/second.&nbsp;</p><p>We receive emails using Google Suite. There is also a plan for non-profits, but since we are not yet an officially registered foundation, we cannot apply for it.</p>
