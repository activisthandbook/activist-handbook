<h2>1) Satyagraha; 'holding firmly to truth' &nbsp;/ moral or ‘principled’ non-violence.</h2>
<p>Satyagraha is a form of non-violent resistance that was conceptualised and practised by Gandhi. Please add links.</p>
<h2>2) Strategic non-violence.</h2>
<p>Defined as different to principled non-violence, strategic non-violence is used because it has been understood to work i.e. to be more effective than violence at achieving lasting, large-scale social change.</p>
<h2>3) Non-violent property destruction and sabotage / the Shambala Warrior prophesy.</h2>
<p>Is it possible to cause property destruction and / or sabotage from a deep place of peace and compassion for those that would benefit from the damage?</p>
<p>Here is one perspective: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-j-nhej8E&amp;t=568s&amp;ab_channel=FacingFuture">the Shambala Warrior prophesy. </a>The essence of this Tibetan Buddhist prophesy is that deeply compassionate and well-trained people will enter the centres of power and dismantle the ‘weapons’ that are destroying the planet (these don't have to be literal weapons; they could be destructive machines related to fossil fuels).</p>
