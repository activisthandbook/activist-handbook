Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones. You can also add translations for your own native language!</li><li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic. </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li><li><strong>Make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li><li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you. You can start writing an article, which others can finish.</li><li><strong>Make it accessible for everyone. </strong>Make sure to provide an alternative title for pictures so that people with screen readers know what is shown too.</li><li><strong>Make it look engaging</strong> with illustrations, pictures and videos.</li></ul><h1>Template page structure&nbsp;</h1><p>Every article should contain the following (in this order):</p><ol><li><strong>Title: </strong>The title should be short and clearly describe what the page is about. It should clearly distinguish it from other pages. It cannot be a sentence or question.</li><li><strong>Subtitle: </strong>The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engines optimisation, it also has to be relevant for website visitors.</li><li><strong>Short introduction. </strong>The introduction should:<ul><li>Explain what the page is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader.</li><li>Outline the contents of the page.</li><li>Encourage people to contribute to the page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Subtopics (bullet list):</strong> If there are any subtopics of the page, make sure to add a list directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".</li><li><strong>Contents: </strong>Make sure to structure the contents using titles.</li><li><strong>Related articles (bullet list): </strong>To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter. They should not be subtopics (as those are already in the 'subtopic' section).</li><li><strong>References to external resources (bullet list):</strong> Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li></ol><h1>How to use the website</h1><p>We want anyone to be able to contribute.
