<ul>
  <li><a href="getting-started"><strong>Getting started with activism</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Here we explain what activism is. We argue anyone can be an activist. Even though you might not refer to yourself as an ‘activist’, we believe this handbook can be useful for anyone who would like to achieve societal change.</li>
  <li><a href="organising"><strong>Organising</strong></a>: We believe that change-makers are more successful together. Learn how to set up an inclusive movement, how to make decisions democratically and how to mobilise people and keep them engaged.</li>
  <li><a href="/tactics"><strong>Tactics</strong></a>: Social change can be achieved in various ways. We will discuss protests, creative actions, digital activism, storytelling and more.</li>
  <li><a href="/wellbeing"><strong>Wellbeing</strong></a>: When trying to make this world a better place, we sometimes forget about our own wellbeing. Learn how you and your movement can become more effective in the long run.</li>
  <li><a href="/communication"><strong>Communication</strong></a>: In this chapter we will discuss how to keep in touch with your fellow activists, how to formulate a message for your target audience and how to reach out to the press.</li>
  <li><a href="/tools"><strong>Tools</strong></a>: We made a toolkit to help you create and communicate. You will find tools for editing videos, designing graphics, managing social media, developing websites and much more.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Our community</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/resources"><strong>Resources</strong></a>: All articles on Activist Handbook have a resource section at the bottom. In addition, we have a large list of resources in various languages about activism in general.</li>
  <li><a href="/communities"><strong>Activist communities</strong></a>: Progressive activist organisations can create their own section on this website where they can add manuals. Instead of having Google Docs all over the place, we build a platform specifically for activists to work on articles together.</li>
  <li><a href="/en/trainings"><strong>Trainings</strong></a><strong>: </strong>We are planning on bringing our online handbook into the real world by providing trainings. Stay tuned for more info!</li>
  <li><a href="support"><strong>Support</strong></a>: Need help getting started with our platform? We are here to help you out!</li>
