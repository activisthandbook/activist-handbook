<p>Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-like platform for organisations and individuals to share and find knowledge on activism - for activists, by activists. Our core team exists out of about 10 people and more than 60 people have joined our Facebook group.<br><br>We are inviting you to join the project! <strong>Fill in </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc77m2XPHKRb1v2pJi82UCxEw5lmV390kdk_gGreRtjK9MqHg/viewform"><strong>our form</strong></a><strong> to become involved and stay updated.</strong> After filling in the form you'll receive an invite link for our next open video call.</p><h1>We meet online</h1><p>We're activists from all over the world, so we cannot regularly meet face to face. Instead, we regularly have video calls. Are you new with Activist Handbook? We would very much like to get to know you during our next call! We also have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/activisthandbook/">Facebook group </a>in which activists can exchange experiences.</p><h1>We value diversity</h1><p>We believe that diversity strengthens our organisation. That is why we encourage people of all genders, sexual preferences and ethnic backgrounds, including people with disabilities, to join our cause.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/diversity.svg" alt="Diversity is our strength"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
