<p>With the current corona crisis going on, video calling tools have become essential for staying in touch. Now, we cannot meet in person, but meeting face to face is still possible with the the video calling tools that we will be discussing. Below you will find a list of the various services that are available.&nbsp;</p><p><mark class="marker-yellow">Activist Handbook is a collaborative project. Anyone can edit and create new pages. Feel free to add information! Just </mark><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/register"><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>create an account</strong></mark></a><mark class="marker-yellow"> or </mark><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/login"><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>log in</strong></mark></a><mark class="marker-yellow"> to start contributing.</mark></p><h1>For large groups</h1><p>None of these video calling tools for large groups offer end-to-end encryption, but they do offer regular encryption. In other words: your call will be encrypted in transit to the server, but the company that offers the service will be able to have access to your video call. If you need more privacy for your organisation, consider looking at the tools for smaller groups.</p><ul><li><a href="https://meet.jit.si"><strong>Jitsi Meet</strong></a>: Jitsi offers a free to use video calling service.
