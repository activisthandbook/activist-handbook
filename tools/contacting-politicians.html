<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/EFForg/contact-congress">Contact Congress (Open Source)</a> - Send emails to members of the US Congress. This was developed by EFF as an open source project. They use it for their own campaigns internally. There is also a hosted version run by Fight for the Future (see below).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/call-congress">Call Congress</a> - Coordinate call-in days to US Congress, the President, or local or corporate targets. Original project from Fight for the Future and Taskforce.is, but with lots of development from <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/call-congress">Mozilla</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/effOrg/call-congress/tree/refactor/master">EFF</a>. Frontend looks like this, <a href="https://call.mozilla.org/">https://call.mozilla.org</a> and the backend looks like <a href="http://callpower.org/easy-to-use/">http://callpower.org</a>.
