<p>Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-style collaborative manual created by activists, for activists, in <a href="/en/about/history">2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="/about/principles">believe</a> that knowledge should be free and available to everyone. We strive to connect globally, learn from various activist undertakings in different political and historical contexts. Cooperation, sharing, diversity and mutuality are important to us. This handbook aims to support <a href="/en/communities/local_circles">local communities</a> who want to learn from activist experiences from their peers around the globe and share their invaluable experience and practices.</p>

<h1>How we work</h1>
<p>To ensure most efficiency on a global scale we’ve adopted <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>, a method of decentralized management and organizational governance. Our core structure is flexible, currently comprising <a href="en/about/logbook">six core circles</a>, each with a different function. <a href="en/about/people">The core volunteers</a> make sure that Activist Handbook functions properly, delivers useful content, comes in multiple languages, has global visibility, is able to connect activists from all over the world by hosting events and discussions and is able to sustain itself.</p>
<p>Chapters on this website are registered under <a href="/en/about/licence">creative commons</a> which means that by following a set of rules, the content of the chapters is open to be distributed, edited and built upon by you. The project relies heavily on the contribution of community members and external partners for its content. We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, we want to share the blueprints so that nobody has to invent one again.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We’re constantly <a href="en/join">looking for new members</a>, both in the core circle and in our community of contributors.&nbsp;</p>
