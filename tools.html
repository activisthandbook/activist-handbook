<p>As activists, we communicate and create continuously. We collected a list of tools that will come in handy for you as as activist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cover two categories of tools on each of the pages listed below. <i>Firstly, </i>we list services that you can start using straight away, are easy to use, and are available at low costs. <i>Secondly,</i> we describe tools that are open source and can be installed on your own <a href="/en/web-server">webserver</a>. These tools require some developer experience to install.</p>

<h1>Our honest approach</h1>
<p>We only recommend tools that we actually like to use. We are not being payed to promote any services. We ask everyone who adds items to our collection to stay objective and review the tools with a critical mindset. Any spam or promotional contributions will be removed. However, if you have developed a useful tool for activists yourself, feel free to share it with us!</p>
<p>As most activist organisations do not have access to large funds, we prefer free and open source services over payed ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we like to see that the products that we use reflect the positive impact we are trying to make on this world. In other words: we do not only assess the quality of the tools that we review, but we also try to look at the people and organisations behind the tools.</p>
