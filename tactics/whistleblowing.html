<p>Whistleblowing is an exposal of any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>violation of company policy/rules;</li>
  <li>violation of law, regulation;</li>
  <li>threat to public interest/national security;</li>
  <li>fraud;</li>
  <li>corruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor.</li>
  <li>Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers.</li>
  <li>Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on: private sector, or public sector</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences.</li>
  <li>A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges. <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VEHxfa7W_t0J:https://www.activisthandbook.org/index.php/Whistleblowing+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=nl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nl&amp;client=safari#cite_note-1">[1]</a></li>
