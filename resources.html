<p>Feel free to add resources about activism on this page. Please make sure the resource follows the following guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>The resource is about activism in general</strong>. If there is a page on this website that is more related, add it on that page. For example, a resource on how to organise a protest march fits better on the page about <a href="/tactics/march">protest marches</a>. This way it becomes easier to find the right resources.</li><li><strong>Resources in other languages should be added to the resource pages of those languages, unless there are translations or subtitles available.</strong> If no resources page exists for your language yet, you can create it yourself.</li><li><strong>Summarise what the resource is about. </strong>Add (if applicable) the author, the year of publication, and a brief summary of the contents of the resource.</li></ul><p>Read resources in other languages: <a href="/nl/resources">Nederlands</a></p><h1>Websites</h1><ul><li><a href="https://beautifulrising.org"><strong>Beautiful Rising</strong></a>: A collection of stories, tactics, principles, theories and methodologies on activism.</li><li><a href="https://advocatesforyouth.org/youth-activist-toolkit/"><strong>Youth Activist Toolkit</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Advocates for Youth (2019): a 64 page document with chapters on getting started with activism, creating a strategy, crafting your message, building collective power, using your power and sustaining a movement.</li><li><a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk"><strong>Seeds for Change's Resources</strong></a>: A collection of articles about campaign skills, consensus decision making, facilitation, skills for working in groups, resources for co-ops and running workshops.
