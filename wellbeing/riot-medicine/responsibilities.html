<p>Medics make up the autonomous part of the healthcare system that attends actions and interfaces with the organizations and individuals involved in protest and civil unrest. Even during the least confrontational actions, participants may need medical assistance. Hot weather can make people ill, and fascists may make surprise attacks against participants. As the level of violence increases, police repression can make it increasingly risky for protesters to use traditional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (1),so social movements must provide their own medical care.</p>
<p>While rare, life-threatening injuries require immediate attention, and survival rates drop with each additional minute before aid arrives. Medics who are on scene can administer lifesaving interventions until the patient can be brought to advanced medical care. In some cases, advanced medical care may be delayed by large crowds, road blocks, or malicious police obstruction; or it may not be available at all.</p>
<p>The term “propaganda of the deed” is often assumed to refer to violence alone, but it means so much more. By helping each other, we encourage others to do the same. In a 2007 essay, the Aftershock Action Alliance described such direct challenges to the State as “insurrectionary mutual aid.”4</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is through acting and learning to act that we will open a path to insurrection. . .</p>
  <p>The force of an insurrection is not the state’s military response, but the social upheaval it generates. Beyond the surface of the armed clash, the importance of any particular revolt should be evaluated by how it managed to expand the paralysis of normality in a given area and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, caring for one another demonstrates the fallibility of existing institutions and that we are capable of providing what the State cannot or will not. Our actions provide the means for reshaping and replacing the existing order.</p>
<h1>Tasks</h1>
<p>Medics’ responsibilities do not begin and end with an action. There is preparation and coordination that needs to be done with organizers and participants beforehand. Ongoing care and jail support may need to happen after actions.</p>
<p>Your responsibilities during actions are something you are likely already familiar with. They may include:5</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing care to injured individuals</li>
  <li>Spreading calm when others may panic</li>
  <li>Evacuating injured persons to safety</li>
  <li>Interfacing with traditional EMS</li>
  <li>Setting up makeshift clinics to care for multiple casualties</li>
  <li>Instructing patients on aftercare</li>
  <li>Providing emotional and psychological support for patients experiencing trauma</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of actions, you will need to work to prepare yourself and others for medical emergencies that may occur in the future. Some of these topics will be covered more in depth as you read this book.</p>
<p><strong>Educate yourself.</strong> Reading this book and practicing medicine in the field is not enough to be a proficient medic. You should supplement the knowledge in this book through courses (formal or informal) with experienced educators.</p>
<p><strong>Study tactics.</strong> Study the tactics and practices of other street medics and stand upon the shoulders of giants. Study the behavior and tactics of police and fascists in your region. Prepare yourself for the confrontations you may encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Train. </strong>Train your body and mind with other medics. Work out together. Run drills together. Become adept in all areas of riot medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate with others.</strong> Learn to work with other organizations in your region. There may be legal observers, anti-repression support, and other organizations that provide mutual aid during actions. Legal support may document injuries to file official police brutality complaints. Medics can catalogue injuries and turn anonymized documentation over to legal teams as part of lawsuits against the police.</p>
<p><strong>Learn the local languages. </strong>There may be one primary language in your region, but not everyone may be able to speak it well. Minorities, immigrants, and refugees have more reason to protest and are more likely to targeted by police brutality or fascist aggression. Learning the basics of other common languages will make it easier to calm and treat patients.</p>
<p><strong>Educate others. </strong>It is your responsibility to educate the next generation of medics. As you learn, teach others. Teach non-medic activists the basics of first aid and treatment for riot control agents so they can care for themselves. A movement or collective that is open and shares will inspire others to join it. By educating others, you will help prevent injuries and minimize lasting damage when medics aren’t present.</p>
<p><strong>Provide post-arrest jail support.</strong> Arrested comrades may be injured while being arrested. They may have psychological trauma from police abuse. Be ready to pick them up after they’ve been arrested. All you need is a medic bag, some food, water, and clean clothes for them to change into.</p>

At times, police road blocks prevented patients from getting to hospitals at all. Medics set up two hotlines, one for physical trauma and one for emotional trauma, to help medical professionals to provide aid to protesters.</i></p>

The week Heather Heyer died, I had exclusive interviews with medics who said state police forced them to stop working on her after the crash — which they believed led to her death. The piece was canceled by my employer at the time, but I’ll never forget what those medics told me. 2019-08. url: https://twitter.com/MaryEmilyOHara/status/1161031331213533184 (visited on 2019-09-01).</li>
