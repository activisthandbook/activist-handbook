<p>What works, when it comes to activism? This is the case studies homepage.</p>
<p>We want to encourage activists and ex-activists to share their experiences and knowledge of particular cases of activism. These could be relating to recent events (as recent as earlier today) or events far back in history. If the case study is experience-based, please only use your experience as a gateway to a more scientific understanding, complete with as many references you can find.</p>
<p>A case study template to help guide activists to record case studies does not yet exist, but feel free to create one.</p>
<p>The tactic template page is for describing different tactics that activists can use, whereas this page is to describe particular cases of tactics, and also strategies being used, as well as examples of organisational models, types of movement, etc etc</p>
<p>Please keep case studies objective and scientific, and not about adulating or blaming individuals or groups for things going right or wrong.</p>
<p>Personal, emotional, and expressive accounts of your experiences of activism are extremely valuable for movement building and learning lessons about ourselves and the successes and mistakes of actions, groups and movements, but please record these on the Personal Accounts pages.</p>
