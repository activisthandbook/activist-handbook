<p><strong>This article is meant both for the Activist Handbook project coordinator, as well as for any other coordinator that wants to learn more about managing projects effectively.</strong></p>
<p>Often, it is quite easy to come up with an idea, but much harder to turn it into reality. Good process facilitation is key:</p>
<h1>Keeping an overview</h1>
<p>With multiple people working on different aspects of the same project, it is important to have someone (or multiple people) that keep an overview.</p>
<h1><strong>Setting clear to-do's</strong></h1>
<p>Turn <i>“let's change the world”</i> into smaller and more manageable concrete steps. Make sure that it is clear who does what when. Constantly follow up on to-do's to see if things are going as planned, and then adapt accordingly.</p>
<h1><strong>Facilitating conversations</strong></h1>
<p>Having productive conversations that make all participants feel comfortable requires active facilitation, especially in online video calls.</p>
<h1>Taking care of wellbeing</h1>
<p>Working together on a project is not just about being as productive as possible. Make sure to continuously keep an eye out for people's mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
