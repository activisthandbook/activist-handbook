  <p>Medicine is not only a science; it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters; it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Patient assessment is the process you will use to investigate a patient’s symptoms, make diagnosis, and select treatment options relevant to their injury or illness. This process is used by lifeguards, EMTs, doctors, and medics around the world. When followed, the patient assessment system will allow you to make quick decisions and to effectively communicate findings to other medical professionals who may assist with or take over care of your patient.</p>
<p>Homeostasis is the regulation of different chemical and physical prop- erties of the body within a narrow range that allows the body to function. This includes temperature, fluid balance, sodium concentration, and blood pH balance. Illness and injury can cause homeostatic failure, and the signs and symptoms of these failures give insight into the patient’s underlying condition. The patient assessment attempts to narrow in on the cause by looking at these symptoms.</p>
<p>The steps described in this chapter do not always need to be followed completely or in the order provided. For treatment of minor injuries where the patient is alert and oriented and they know exactly what happened, it may be sufficient to treat their single injury without conducting a full examination. In the context of riot medicine, following these steps completely is most applicable for patients with trauma and illnesses with rapid onset. Regardless, it is good to memorize these steps so that you can quickly walk through a mental checklist and at the very least ask yourself “Is this step relevant to the current situation?”</p>
<h1>Scene Size-Up</h1>
<p>Your assessment of the patient begins before you even see or hear them. Environmental information will serve as your starting point for what may have gone wrong. The weather, the type of action, the demographic attending the action, and the presence of police or other opposition will give you a starting point about the types of illnesses and injuries to expect.</p>
<p>Once you have identified a patient, either by them coming up to you, or you spotting someone who appears to need care, look around for possible causes of injury. Are they approaching you on their own, or did they need to be carried over by someone? Are they standing or laying down? What have the police been doing? What is the crowd in the vicinity doing? These will provide clues about their illness or injury.</p>
<h2>Scene Safety</h2>
<p>Before you attempt to render care, ensure that the scene is safe enough for you to do so. You cannot help anyone if you become a casualty yourself. Look for environmental dangers like burning petrol or downed power lines. Also be aware of threats from police or opposition. If your action was attacked by someone in a vehicle, ensure the vehicle is no longer a threat before approaching victims. If someone was assaulted by nationalists, you may need an impromptu security detail and spotters to keep you safe while you render care or perform an evacuation.</p>
<p>If the scene becomes unsafe while you are caring for a patient, you will either need to leave so you do not become another casualty or rapidly evacuate the patient. You cannot help anyone if you are incapacitated through injury, and you will add to the burden that other medics face.</p>
<h2>Mechanism of Illness or Injury</h2>
<p>Attempt to identify the possible mechanism of injury (MOI). The MOI will give you clues about what types of injuries the patient has and how severe they may be. Is it possible the person fell from a height? Do they appear to be contaminated with a chemical agent? Have police been firing rubber bullets, tear gas, or flashbang grenades? If the patient is unresponsive, ask people around the patient if they saw what happened.</p>
<p>Look and see how many people are injured. If there is more than one, you will need to quickly triage the situation and determine who is most in need of immediate care. Steps for triaging mass casualty incidents can be found later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Observe the patient. Do they appear to be awake and alert, or are they slumped over or disoriented? Are they holding an injured extremity? Do they appear to be in great distress of are they relatively calm? None of these questions or observations will completely determine your diagnosis or treatment. They are merely a starting point.</p>
<h1>Body Substance Isolation</h1>
<p>Body substance isolation (BSI) is the set the precautionary measures taken to reduce the transmission of disease via mucous membranes and moist body substances. In the context of riot medicine, this primarily means wearing gloves whenever touching a patient. You may want to wear a surgical mask and eye protection while caring for patients to reduce the risk of contracting disease if the patient has blood that is spurting or if you have a compromised immune system.</p>
<p>If you suspect that someone will imminently need medical care, you may want to preemptively put on your examination gloves. Possible scenarios include increasing aggression between protesters and police or a march accelerating as it approaches their opposition. Even if you are not able to immediately reach a patient or potential patient, or if they later refuse care, you may still be glad you preemptively donned your gloves. This is a better alternative than fumbling with tight gloves and sweaty hands as a situation becomes critical.</p>
<h1>Consent</h1>
<p>Before you touch or begin treating a patient, you need to obtain their in- formed consent. Every person has the right to their own bodily autonomy, and you need to get their permission before assisting them. To do this, introduce yourself and state your qualifications. If you are uncertified, the patient has the right to know this. Do not overstate your credentials as this violates the “informed” part of “informed consent.”</p>
<p>If the patient appears to be unconscious, say hello. If they do not respond, say hello loudly and shake them. If they still do not respond, attempt to wake them with a painful stimulus. Instructions follow later in this chapter. If they still do not respond, you have permission to treat them through what is known as implied consent (1). Implied consent is the assumption that any unconscious person or person in an altered mental state would want to receive aid in an emergency situation.</p>
<h1>Primary Assessment</h1>
<p>The primary assessment is performed on all patients and rapidly identifies life-threatening medical problems. Memorizing this protocol gives you structure during the first moments of an emergency. During the primary assessment, the respiratory and circulatory systems are examined and managed, the spine is protected if the MOI indicates possible spinal injury, and major wounds are exposed and treated.</p>
<h2>ABCDE</h2>
<p>The primary assessment uses the mnemonic ABCDE to to remind the medic of the main steps of the process: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and expose/examine injuries. These step do not always need to be done in this order as different circumstances might dictate different checks first.</p>

<p>To begin your primary assessment, approach the patient and obtain consent. If the patient is not responsive, and the MOI is either uncertain or suggests a spinal injury, you will need to move the head and neck to a neutral position and stabilize the cervical spine. Protection of the c-spine should not take precedence over more immediately life-threatening conditions. A rule of thumb is to treat what kills the patient first. A full description of how to immobilize and protect the c-spine can be found in Chapter 15 (“Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries”).</p>
<p>If you are working with a buddy, one medic protects the c-spine, and another medic performs the rest of the primary assessment. If your buddy is not medically trained, instruct them on how to stabilize the head and neck while you perform the other checks.</p>
<p>When you are checking a patient’s ABCDEs, if you find that they have no pulse or are not breathing, you will need to begin artificial ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, together known as basic life support</p>
<p>(BLS). Instructions for how to perform BLS can be found in Chapter 11 (“Basic Life Support”).</p>

<h3>Airway</h3>
<p>The respiratory tract (airway) is the path air travels through from the atmosphere into the lungs and back out. The upper respiratory tract is the mouth, nose, pharynx, and larynx. The lower respiratory tract is the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. If this path becomes blocked, oxygen cannot reach the lungs and enter the bloodstream. This is a life-threatening medical emergency.</p>
<p>If your patient is responsive ask them to open their mouth. If they are unresponsive, open their mouth. Check for objects that may block the airway such as food, vomit, dirt, or dislodged teeth. If you find something, remove it. If there is liquid in their mouth, you will need to roll them into the rescue position to drain it, or use a manual suction pump. Rolling the patient is covered in <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 15 </mark>(“Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries”), and the rescue position is covered in <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 11</mark> (“Basic Life Support”). Check for inflammation that may narrow the airway.</p>
<p>In an unresponsive patient, you will need to open their airway. If they do not have a suspected c-spine injury, open their mouth with the head-tilt maneuver. If they have a suspected c-spine injury, open their mouth with the jaw-thrust maneuver. See <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 11</mark> (“Basic Life Support”) for details on these maneuvers and opening a patient’s airway.</p>
<p>In an unresponsive patient, you will need to open their airway. If they do not have a suspected c-spine injury, open their mouth with the head-tilt maneuver. If they have a suspected c-spine injury, open their mouth with the jaw-thrust maneuver. See <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 11</mark> (“Basic Life Support”) for details on these maneuvers and opening a patient’s airway.</p>
<h3>Breathing</h3>
<p>If your patient is responsive, ask them to take a deep breath. If their breath is labored, painful, or noisy, they may have a chest or lung injury. Inspect their chest and for traumatic injuries. Touching this part of the body may be psychologically or emotionally uncomfortable for the patient. Reaffirm consent before proceeding. You may need to remove clothing to do this; however, it may be unwise to remove clothing at an action because you may need to redress them to protect them from police violence, and exposing their body could reveal identifying features and tattoos.</p>
<p>If your patient is unresponsive, lean down, put your cheek near their mouth, and put one hand on their abdomen. Look, listen, and feel for signs of respiration. Look for the rise and fall of their chest and abdomen. Listen for the sound of air moving in and out of their mouth and nose. Feel for air moving against your cheek. If their breathing is shallow or irregular, check for injuries to the chest.</p>
<p>A patient with no circulation (cardiac arrest) or a stroke may still have agonal respiration. Agonal respiration is gasping or labored breathing as brainstem reflex to a lack of oxygen in the brain. It should not be confused with normal respiration as it is not sufficient to deliver oxygen to the body.</p>
<h3>Circulation</h3>
<p>Check for the presence of a pulse. If your patient is responsive or breathing, use the radial pulse. If your patient is unresponsive, use the carotid pulse. Check their pulse for at least 10 seconds. This is necessary as a patient may have a weak pulse because of shock or hypothermia.</p>
<p>When checking for a carotid pulse, check on the side of the neck nearer to you, so you do not accidentally appy pressure to the trachea. If you cannot find the carotid pulse, check for the radial, brachial, or femoral pulse (Figure 6.2). Some first aid texts suggest using the pedal pulse, but this is not recommended for medics if there are other options. The pedal pulse is more difficult to locate and requires removing shoes and socks. Checking the carotid artery for a pulse is advantageous as it can be done simultaneously while you check for signs of breathing.</p>
<p>If you or your buddy has a pulse oximeter, while one of you is checking for the pulse manually, the other should attach it to one of the patient’s fingers before moving on to assist with other parts of the primary assessment <mark class="marker-yellow">(Figure 6.3</mark>). Pulse oximetry is coverd in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Note that during this step you are simply checking for the presence of pulse to determine if the patient is in cardiac arrest. Quality and regularity of the pulse are investigated during the secondary assessment.</p>

<h3>Disability</h3>
<p>Consider disabilities the patient may have that may cause or exacerbate their injuries.</p>
<p>If the MOI suggests a spinal injury, immobilize the patient’s head and neck. This is done to protect the spinal cord and prevent permanent disability or paralysis. A more complete guide on how to treat suspected head and neck injuries can be found in Chapter 15 (“Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries”).</p>
<p>Check if the patient appears to be having a diabetic emergency. Test their blood for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and consider administering glucose. Treatment for for this can be found in Chapter 25 (“Blood Glucose Disorders”).</p>
<h3>Expose/Examine Injuries</h3>
<p>Check for bleeding. If the patient has a suspected head or spinal injury, do not move, shift, or roll the patient during this process. Check underneath clothing for traces of blood. Move your hands under the patient’s arms, legs, and torso and look for traces of blood on your gloves as an indication of bleeding between checking each location. If you find hemorrhaging, this needs to be managed immediately, including before beginning CPR or artificial ventilation.</p>
<p>Examine the patient for additional injuries and expose them for further treatment. You may need to remove or cut away bulky clothing. Removing or cutting away clothing can have privacy concerns as it may expose a patient’s tattoos or identifying birthmarks. Patients may be unhappy if their clothes are cut away, especially if it is unnecessary. If the patient is awake and an injury does not appear life-threatening, you should explain what you want to do and why, then wait for their permission before cutting away clothing.</p>
<h2>Assessment Ordering</h2>
<p>Following the ABCDEs by rote may not always make sense. If your patient approaches you, and asks for help with a deep cut, it probably does not make sense to start by examining their airway and checking for a pulse. An unresponsive patient may have the order of the primary assessment changed depending on what the assumed injury or illness may be.</p>
<p>In a combat or other major trauma scenario, the priority will usually be checking for and controlling hemorrhaging. Excessive blood loss is itself a medical emergency, and if your patient requires CPR, blood loss will reduce its efficacy. Another mnemonic used in combat medicine is MARCH for massive hemorrhage, airway, respiration, circulation, and hypothermia. In a combat situation, or during a riot, evacuation may be delayed, and there may be risk of patient hypothermia, especially after cutting away clothing or otherwise exposing injuries. An unclothed, normothermic patient will neither gain nor lose heat in a room at 28 C <mark class="marker-yellow">[SOURCE 25]</mark>. Thus, even on warm days, a partially clothed patient may become hy- pothermic, and care should be taken to prevent this.</p>

<p>For all other cases, using ABC is generally the best approach. Note that patients who are not breathing may have a weak pulse and that time is better spent beginning basic life support than searching for a pulse.</p>
<h1>Secondary Assessment</h1>
<p>The primary assessment is to check for and manage immediate threats to a patient’s life. Once it is complete, pause to reevaluate your situation. Is the scene still safe, or do you need to move the patient a short distance away from conflict? Are there other patients who may need more immediate care? There may be additional considerations like ensuring someone is able to watch for and redirect traffic or that someone has informed other medics that you are treating a patient.</p>
<p>The secondary assessment is a more thorough check of the patient’s condition and medical history. If you are dealing with a single patient, consider having your buddy take notes about your measurements and other observations. If the patient’s condition worsens or another medic takes over care of your patient, these notes will help them with their care and diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Head-to-Toe Examination</h2>
<p>The head-to-toe examination is exactly what it sounds like. It consists of examining your patient from their head to their toes checking for injuries and symptoms of serious medical conditions. You will look and feel for injuries, listen for unusual bodily noises, and smell for signs of disease.</p>
<p>During examination, remember that the human body has bilateral symmetry. To a large degree, the left and the right side of the body look the same. When checking a body part for injury, you can compare it to its opposite for signs of deformity. It is thus often useful, as long as you do not suspect spinal injury, to position them (or ask them to position themselves) comfortably on their back so you can readily access and compare both sides.</p>
<p>During the secondary assessment, it is recommend to explain to your patient what you are doing. This helps to humanize the process and will make the patient less nervous or uncomfortable. There is also research that suggests saying what you are doing aloud will help prevent you from making mistakes <mark class="marker-yellow">[SOURCE 26]</mark>. Stating what you are doing out loud will also help your buddy take notes and allow them to double check that you have not forgotten anything.</p>
<p>If your patient has recently been the victim of violence or assault, it is additionally recommended to re-check for consent each time before you touch them, especially before touching their head, neck, or torso. This helps your patient feel like they have regained control over the situation as well as autonomy over their own body. It may also help prevent retraumatizing them.</p>
<p>If you suspect your patient has a spinal injury, skip parts of the exam that require moving the patient. If you are able to perform a focused spine assessment and you have cleared your patient of suspected spinal injury, resume the secondary assessment and check areas that were previously unreachable. <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 15</mark> (“Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries”) explains how to perform a focused spine assessment.</p>
<h3>Head and Neck</h3>
<p>Check the mouth and neck for injuries or bleeding that may block the airway or cause pulmonary aspiration. Check the lips for cyanosis. This may indicate hypothermia or hypoxia.</p>
<p>Check the nose and ears for fluid, specifically cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Palpate the skull and face for tenderness, depressions, and deformities. Run your fingers through their hair to check for obscured cuts and bleed- ing. Check the pupils’ dilation, and ask if the patient has disturbances to their vision. Both are signs of brain injury. See <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 15</mark> (“Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries”) for more information on brain injuries.</p>
<p>Check the trachea for damage. Ensure it runs down the middle of the neck. A deviated trachea is a sign of a tension pneumothorax. See <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 16 </mark>(“Chest Injuries”) for more information on pneumothoraces.</p>
<p>Check for distention of the jugular veins on either side of the neck. This may be a sign of shock or heart failure. See <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 14</mark> (“Shock”) for more information on shock.</p>
<p>Palpate the spine from the base of the skull to the shoulders, feeling for tenderness, muscle rigidity, and deformity. This may indicate injuries to the muscles, tendons, and ligaments, or it may indicate fractures.</p>
<h3>Shoulders and Chest</h3>
<p>Palpate the trapezius and shoulders for signs of rigidity. Palpate the entire clavicle (collarbone) for dislocation and fracture.</p>
<p>Check the chest for cuts and bleeding. Ask the patient to take deep breaths while you apply compression to the sides of the ribcage. This should not be painful. Check for signs of an open traumatic pneumothorax (“sucking chest wound”). While the patient breathes, look for bilateral symmetry in their chest movements. Asymmetric chest movements may be a sign of pneumothorax or flail chest. Further discussion of flail chest pneumothorax can be found in <mark class="marker-yellow">Chapter 16</mark> (“Chest Injuries”).</p>
<h3>Abdomen</h3>
<p>Divide the abdomen into four quadrants, with the belly button at the center. Lightly palpate the four quadrants with the palm of your hand, feeling for muscle rigidity, and asking the patient for any tenderness. Look and feel for distension (outward expansion), bruising, swelling, and discoloration. This may be a sign of internal bleeding or hernia.</p>
<p>If the patient has a penis, check for priapism (erectness in absence of stimulation). This may be a sign of a spinal injury, brain injury, or drug intoxication.</p>
<h3>Back</h3>
<p>Check for bleeding and deformities. Palpate each vertebra for tenderness or deformities, an indication of spinal injury. Check the ribs and scapulae (shoulder blades) for fractures. Palpate the muscles and check for rigidity.</p>
<h3>Arms and Legs</h3>
<p>Check the arms from the shoulders to the hands and the legs from groin to feet, checking for signs of injury such as bleeding, tenderness, swelling, or muscle rigidity. Check the wrists for a medical ID bracelet.</p>
<p>You will need to check both hands and feet for circulation, sensation, and motion (CSM). Checking the CSM assess whether there is nerve damage at the extremity or spine and whether there is injury to blood vessels running to and from the extremity.</p>
<p><strong>CSM</strong></p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>C</strong></td>
        <td>Circulation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>S</strong></td>
        <td>Sensation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>M</strong></td>
        <td>Motion</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>In patients with suspected spinal damage, ensure you do not comment on a lack of motion. Doing so may cause the patient to attempt to look at their limb to see if it’s moving or not. It may additionally distress them that their limb is not moving. Likewise, avoid testing for sensation if there is a lack of motion.</p>
<p><strong>Circulation. </strong>To check for circulation in the arms and legs, check for the presence of the radial pulse and pedal pulse respectively. Additionally, check capillary refill time (CRT). This is done by elevating the hand or foot above the heart and pressing down on the lunula (fingernail bed) for 3 seconds. Measure how long it takes for reddish pink color to return to the lunula. Normal CRT is less than 2 seconds. Increased CRT can be a sign of shock, dehydration, decreased peripheral perfusion, or peripheral artery disease.</p>
<p><strong>Sensation.</strong> To check for sensation, ask the patient if they have numbness, tingling, or itching, or if their extremity feels hot or cold. These abnormal sensations are called parethsia. Check sensitivity to touch by lightly touching their fingers and toes. To check the degree of sensitivity, have the patient look away and either scratch or lightly pinch a finger or toe. Ask them to identify the stimulus as scratching or pinching. Sensation checking should be done on the pinky finger and thumb of each hand and the little toe and big toe of each foot.</p>
<p><strong>Motion.</strong> To check for motion, check for flexion and extension in the hands and feet. You may need to omit testing injured extremities. Check flexion in the hands by asking the patient to squeeze both your hands at the same time; doing them in parallel allows detection of reduced strength in one or the other. Check extension in the hands by placing your hands on the back of the patient’s hands and asking them push against them by rotating their wrist so their knuckles move toward their forearm. To check flexion in the feet, put your hands against the bottom of the patient’s feet and ask them to push against your hands. To check extension in the feet, place your hands on the tops of the patient’s feet and ask them pull up. When checking flexion and extension, the patient should be able to apply a moderate amount of pressure. Weakness (paresis) or a lack motion (paralysis) indicates nerve or brain injury.</p>
<h2>Vital Signs</h2>
<p>Checking the patient’s vital signs gives you measurements about their overall health. Checking the ABCs during the primary assessment will indicate if the patient is at immediate risk of death. During the secondary assessment, detailed measurements give clues to the underlying illness or injury as well as its progression. Measuring vital signs checks respiration, circulation, thermoregulation, and brain function.</p>
<p>Vital signs should be checked and recorded every 15 to 20 minutes. If you have a buddy who is stabilizing the head, they may be able to take vital signs while doing so; spine immobilization always takes priority, however. Patients with severe injuries or illnesses should be checked more often. Checking subsequent measurements against the ini- tial measurements indicates whether the patient’s condition is improving or worsening.</p>
<h3>Level of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Level of consciousness (LOC) is a measure of brain function and mental status. Brain function may be impaired for a number of reasons including swelling of the brain from trauma, inadequate oxygenation of the brain, the patient being too hot or cold, or low or high blood glucose among other causes.</p>
<p>To measure the LOC, medics use the simple classification system AVPU for alert, responsive to verbal stimuli, responsive to painful stimuli, or unresponsive.</p>
<p><strong>AVPU</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alert.</strong> A patient is alert if they are fully awake or can be woken from sleep. They are classified as oriented times 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether they know who they are, where they are, the approximate time, and the events immediately preceding their injury or illness. Criteria for orientation are listed in <mark class="marker-yellow">Table 6.5</mark>.</p>

<p>In the context of riot medicine, you may not want to directly ask a patient’s name since this is may violate their privacy and anonymity, especially if police or journalists are present. It is sufficient to ask “Do you know your name?”</p>
<p>When communicating these findings to other medical professionals, this is typically stated like “the patient is alert and oriented times four” or “the patient is alert and knows their name and place but not time or event.”</p>
<p><strong>Responsive to verbal stimulus. </strong>If your patient is not alert, they may still have enough higher brain function to respond to verbal stimulus. Say “Hello! Wake up!” If they do not respond, repeat this louder. The patient may not be able to verbally respond but may make a grunt or moan, open their eyes, or make movements in their limbs.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive to painful stimulus</strong>. If your patient does not respond to verbal stimuli, you should attempt to elicit a response via a painful stimulus. There are two types of stimulus: central stimulus and peripheral stimulus. Response to a peripheral stimulus may be the result of reflex and not higher brain function. Conversely, they may elicit no response if there is nerve damage.</p>
<p>The painful stimulus should be done for 5 to 10 seconds with increasing force or until the patients responds. A response is a patient making a grunt or other noise, opening their eyes, or moving some part of their body.</p>
<p><u>Trapezius squeeze</u>. The trapezius squeeze is a central stimulus. The trapezius is the muscle that connects the shoulder to the neck. Use your hand to apply pressure and twist the upper portion of the trapezius.</p>
<p><u>Mandibular pressure</u>. Mandibular pressure is a central stimulus. The mandibular nerve is a nerve that runs along the mandible (lower jaw). Use your thumb to apply pressure just below the hinge of the jaw.</p>
<p><u>Supraorbital pressure</u>. Supraorbital pressure is a central stimulus. The supraorbital nerve is the largest cranial nerve. It runs along the upper ridge of the eye socket. Use your thumb to apply pressure. Supraorbital pressure is not recommended if there is local trauma.</p>
<p><u>Nailbed pressure</u>. Nailbed pressure is a peripheral stimulus. Apply pressure to the nailbed by gripping the patient’s finger between your thumb and index finger. Use your thumbnail to press down on the lunula. If you cannot apply sufficient pressure with your hands, hold a pen in the palm of your hand, put the patient’s finger between your middle and ring finger so that their fingernail is against the pen, make a fist, and use your fingertips to squeeze their nailbed against the pen.</p>
<p>Nailbed pressure is the easiest to apply quickly and successfully with the added advantage that it does not look like you are obviously trying to cause pain to the patient, something which may upset the patient’s comrades or other bystanders.</p>
<p>As a note, the sternal rub is not recommended as a painful stimulus as it may cause bruising. If the patient has breasts, onlookers may not perceive it as a medical procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Unresponsive</strong>. A patient is unresponsive if they do not respond to painful stimuli.</p>
