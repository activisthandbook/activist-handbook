<p>On this page you will learn how to add links to articles. There are two ways to add links: by typing in the link <strong>manually</strong>, or by using the <strong>Insert Link to Page</strong> button. If you are inexperienced, we recommend using the Insert Page function.</p>
<p>In addition, you will learn how to save a permanent copy of an external webpage by archiving it.</p>
<h1>Manually</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you are <a href="/en/support/log-in-or-register">logged in</a>.</li>
  <li>Start <a href="/en/support/edit-create-move-or-delete-a-page">editing</a> a page.</li>
  <li><strong>Select some text</strong> and click the <strong>Link</strong> icon in the formatting bar or press <strong>ctrl+K</strong> (Mac: <strong>cmd+K</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Insert Link to Page</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you are <a href="/en/support/log-in-or-register">logged in</a>.</li>
  <li>Start <a href="/en/support/edit-create-move-or-delete-a-page">editing</a> a page.</li>
  <li><strong>Select some text</strong> and click the <strong>Insert Link to Page </strong>icon (right next to the Link icon).</li>
  <li>A dialog will open in which you can select a page. On the left side, you can see all folders. On the left side you can see the pages in the folder that you have selected. <strong>Select a page</strong> and click the blue <strong>Select</strong> button in the bottom right of the dialog. The correct link has now automatically been added.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Save a permanent copy using archive.org</h1>
<p>Often, we link to external resources. However, web pages might be deleted or the URL changes. To make sure the resource stays available forever, we use a tool provided by archive.org.</p>
<p>To save a permanent copy of a webpage, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/save"><strong>web.archive.org/save</strong></a>. Then <strong>fill in the URL</strong> of the website you want to save and click <strong>Save page</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the link to the saved webpage and add it to a resource like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Title of webpage by Author Name (2020) [<a href="https://web.archive.org/">Archived version</a>]</li>
</ul>
