<p>In order to protect your rights, you need to understand them. "Rights" is here understood as <i>legal </i>rights, rather than any moral, philosophical or religious rights. We are not here to tell you what you should and should not do, but by improving our understanding of our rights together we can better make decisions about what to do.</p>
<p>The rights of activists are different between different countries, and often even in different regions of the same country.&nbsp;</p>
