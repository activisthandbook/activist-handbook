<h1>Tips</h1>
<h2>Subject</h2>
<h3>"Read Me Now"</h3>
<p>If the receiver doesn’t read the newsletter at that point, they almost certainly never will. Therefore, you have to<mark class="marker-yellow"> make the subject stand out so much that they want to choose to read your email</mark> over all other emails and life distractions at the instant.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<h3>One Goal - One Call-to-Action</h3>
<p>Many marketing experts argue that <mark class="marker-yellow">each newsletter should have one clear goal and one clear call-to-action</mark> (CTA), and this should be the first content<strong> at the top </strong>of the newsletter. <i>A call to action is an instruction to the reader to do an action immediately.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Put the CTA into a format that encourages readers to click it, such as a button. You can even do the same CTA multiple times in the same newsletter.</p>
<h3>Interesting additional content</h3>
<p>Consider adding <strong>interesting, relevant content</strong> to the newsletter that has no purpose for your organisation. This can encourage readers to engage with the newsletter and look out for future editions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tips and advice</li>
  <li>News from the wider world. For example, from politics, activism, or something else relevant to your readers.</li>
  <li>Fun facts</li>
  <li>Interesting media (article, video, book etc.). One trade-off to consider is that online media may draw the attention of your reader away from your newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tone</h3>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Define what your tone will be</mark>, and keep it consistent thoughout the newsletters. Are you formal or informal? Conversational? Do you use slang? Or would you prefer to write the newsletter like a compelling novel?</p>
<h3>Write for your audience</h3>
<p>Firstly, your content should be <strong>easily</strong> <strong>understandable. </strong>Bear in mind that if you are writing a newsletter, you probably know more about your organisation and the relevant topics than your readers do. You should use Layman's terms, avoid acronyms, and avoid assuming too much knowledge of your readers.</p>
<p>Secondly, your content should be <strong>interesting for </strong><i><strong>them</strong></i>. What are they interested in? What sort of content? What format of content? For example, gifs are a great way of encouraging interaction from some (particularly young) demographics, but not everyone.</p>
<h3>Short and simple</h3>
<p>Even if you can write several thousand super interesting words, don’t. Or at least don’t do this in the newsletter. <mark class="marker-yellow">Keep it short and simple so people can get the information they need from it in less than a minute.</mark> If needed, you can link readers to your website for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Direct to your website</h3>
<p>If you’d like to offer readers the chance to read more, or simply to direct traffic towards your website, then direct readers to your website for more information.</p>
<h3>Be consistent (but creative!)</h3>
<p>This doesn’t mean it always has to be the same (and it shouldn’t be!). But <mark class="marker-yellow">be consistent enough in the style, tone and overall purpose of your newsletter that readers know what the expect.</mark></p>
