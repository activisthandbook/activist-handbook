<p><strong>In this guide, we will go though all the steps to help you welcome our new members. This is mostly a guide for the communications team, but we still advice all coordinators to go through all of the steps, so that you understand how we work.</strong></p>
<p>Summary of steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Invitation to join</li>
  <li>Signup form</li>
  <li>Welcome emails</li>
  <li>Follow up questions</li>
  <li>Message via Slack</li>
  <li>Schedule video call</li>
  <li>Invitation to events</li>
  <li>Engaging with team <strong>üëâ </strong><i>This last step is especially important for non-communication coordinators.</i></li>
</ol>
<h1>Invitation to join</h1>
<p>There are many ways to know if people are interested in our project. The best way to get people involved in our project is to actively approach them. This is a time intensive task, but definitely worth it if well done.</p>
<p>Make sure you coordinate with others who is going to approach who, so that people do not get approached multiple times!</p>
<h2>Interested in event</h2>
<p>Send a message to people who are interested in a Facebook event to turn that ‚ÄòInterested‚Äô or ‚ÄòGoing‚Äô click into actually attending:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey &lt;&lt;First Name&gt;&gt;, it's so cool you're interested in our &lt;&lt;Event about‚Ä¶&gt;&gt;. We're very happy to welcome you! - &lt;&lt;First Name&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If people respond with e.g. ‚ÄòHappy to attend!‚Äô, follow up with something like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Awesome! Did already you sign up for our updates? http://activism.rocks/join</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also try to include the link in the first message. However, Facebook (rightfully so) blocks people from spamming lots of people with links. You cannot send too many messages with the same link to people who you have never talked with before. However, if you get a response, Facebook is less likely to mark it as spam.</p>
<h1>Signup form</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Welcome emails</strong></h1>
<p>To save time, we <strong>automatically</strong> send a series of welcome emails to new members using Mailchimp automations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First email: confirmation</h2>
<p><i>Immediately after someone signs up</i>, we send an email to confirm we have received their signup. The primary call to action is to fill in a form with additional follow up questions (see section below for more info).&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> How would you like to contribute, *|FNAME|*?</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Thank you for joining the Activist Handbook community, *|FNAME|*.</p>
  <p><strong>We'll reach out to you soon. To make sure we can get you in touch with the right coordinator, make sure to fill in <u>this form</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>In the meantime, you can get started here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meet our team by joining our <u>Slack communication channel</u>.</li>
    <li>Join one of our <u>upcoming online events</u>. Feel free to bring a friend!</li>
    <li>Want to help us grow? Share us in your Instagram story!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We hope we'll be able to meet you soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Second email: personal welcome message</h2>
<p><i>After one day, </i>the second email is sent, which appears more personal (even though it is still sent automatically).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Welcome *|FNAME|*!</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Hey *|FNAME|*,</p>
  <p>Welcome to Activist Handbook, I'm excited to have you on our team! How about we have a video call soon?</p>
  <p>To meet the rest of our members, join <u>our Slack group</u>. It would be great if you could briefly introduce yourself there, so that the others know who you are.</p>
  <p>Also, make sure to let us know how you would like to contribute.</p>
  <p>Best,<br>&lt;&lt;First Name&gt;&gt;</p>
  <p>P.S. Feel free to contact me any time if you have questions!</p>

<h2>Third email: checking-in</h2>
<p><i>After two weeks,</i> we send an email to check-in with the new member, to see if they need any help getting started. People often sign up, but then forget about it because they are busy with other stuff. This email is a friendly reminder that they signed up for Activist Handbook.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject: </strong>Checking-in</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Hey,</p>
  <p>Just checking in, *|FNAME|*. I saw you recently joined our group. Do you need any help getting started?</p>
  <p>Know that you can always send me a message via Slack or WhatsApp:<br>+31 6 57 70 48 83</p>
  <p>I hope to see you soon at one of our events!</p>
  <p>Best,<br>&lt;&lt;First Name&gt;&gt;</p>
