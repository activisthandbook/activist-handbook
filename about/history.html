<p style="text-align:justify;">Activist Handbook was originally created by six activists (Sean Curry, Niks Derums, Joppe Hoekstra, Marijn Prins, Elizabete Vegnere and Daniel Whooley) from various countries in Europe during the FYEG Summercamp Hackathon 2019 in Serbia. We wanted to create a guidebook for fellow activists that would empower them to fight for change. Now, we have a team of coordinators that lead our six different teams.</p>
