<h1>In short</h1>
<p><strong>You can contribute:</strong> We are an open community that empowers progressive activists all over the world. Your knowledge and experiences are valuable to millions of fellow world-changers. Anyone can contribute to the Activist Handbook, you too!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learn from others:</strong> On our site we have guides on how to grow your movement, make a successful petition and organise a protest. All knowledge is complemented by personal experiences of activists. Information is adapted to your local context. And if some content is missing, you can add it yourself to help others.</p>
<p><strong>For activists, by activists:</strong> Activist Handbook was made during a two-day hackathon by young activists from all across Europe. It is an open source, free to use, platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Radical transparency</h1>
<p>We share who we are and what we do in a radically transparent way. All our documents are publicly available, we share recordings of our meetings and all our finances are open out there for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Our goal is clear: we are here to train rebels to challenge the status quo, and we are not afraid to tell the world all about it. However, t<i>his does not mean we do not care about privacy, quite the contrary.&nbsp;</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are working on an article that explains our approach of radical transparency in more detail.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>👉 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5vjfatH8ICkhB7FsHX6skMU3kCcgLKZfkkjsSYNtNo/edit?usp=sharing">Help us write it</a>.</p>
