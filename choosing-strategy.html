<h1>Six types of strategy</h1>
<h2>1</h2>
<h2>Conventional activist strategy, including political / organisational / NGO-type&nbsp;</h2>
<p>(required for global systems change[s] -see evidence base)</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<h2>Nonviolent direct action (NVDA) &amp; mass civil disobedience&nbsp;</h2>
<p>(required for global systems change[s] -see evidence base)</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<h2>Sabotage (infrastructural) with no direct harm to life&nbsp;</h2>
<p>(worth considering in context -see evidence base)</p>
<h2>4</h2>
<h2>Violence -defensive&nbsp;</h2>
<p>(rarely recommended)</p>
<h2>5</h2>
<h2>Violence -offensive&nbsp;</h2>
<p>(not recommended)</p>
<h2>6</h2>
<h2>Dual Power, as pursued by Social Ecology theory.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>‘Building the new society in the shell of the old, without permission’. Could include elements of 1-5, depending on application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Defining your strategy</h1>
<p>(adapted from Gene Sharp,<i> </i><a href="http://www.cfic.org.uk/media/From%20dictatorship%20to%20democracy.pdf"><i>‘From Dictatorship to Democracy’ </i></a>-Sharp is considered by some to be the ‘godfather’ of civil disobedience.)</p>
<p><i><strong>A strategy is a carefully arranged set of tactics to achieve a strategic aim. Tactical goals should incrementally achieve the strategic aim.</strong></i></p>
<h2>1</h2>
<h2>Define your Grand Strategic Aim, (GSA) and Grand Strategy to reach this aim.</h2>
<p>Be realistic. What can you reasonably achieve? Is your Grand Strategic Aim to get a piece of legislation changed, or to bring down / change a whole government? Or is it ‘systems change(s)’ Which systems? How? Consider starting with a smaller GSA.</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<h2>Define your campaign strategies.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A campaign is subservient to the overall Grand Strategy (unless your GSA is small enough that you only have one campaign). Ideally, campaign strategies will define campaigns in series, gradually escalating in impact, until the GSA is achieved.</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<h2>Use tactics to serve strategies</h2>
<p>Tactics are subservient to campaign strategies and Grand Strategies. See ‘Choosing your tactics’ below. Tactics must be relevant to achieving strategies. Tactics without encompassing strategies to direct them (plans of collections of tactics towards a strategic aim) are aimless and can even be counter-productive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Choosing your tactics</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>“In the world of give and take, tactics is the art of how to take and how to give… <strong>how the Have-nots can take power away from the Haves</strong>”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">- Saul Alinsky (<a href="https://activisthandbook.org/en/rules-for-radicals">Rules for Radicals</a>, p.92)</p>

<h2>A 4-Step Process</h2>
<p><i>This section was based on the chapter 'Using your power' in </i><a href="https://advocatesforyouth.org/youth-activist-toolkit/"><i>Youth Activist Toolkit</i></a><i>, by Advocates for Youth (2019). Insight from Gene Sharp has also been added.</i></p>
<p>Here are some quick steps to help you decide what tactics to use. These steps can also apply to strategies, i.e. collections of tactics:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make clear within your team and to the public, what the tactical aim is. </strong>You are calling upon others to do something, so make sure they know exactly what you want. <i>(Unless you are using covert tactics and strategy)</i></li>
  <li><strong>Get the attention of your targets. </strong>Who are affected by this tactic? Who might support your cause? Who has power to decide on the issue?</li>
  <li><strong>Use your power and act collectively. </strong>Whatever you do, do it together with others. The harsh truth: you will probably not achieve your goal after a single tactical action, so make sure to build your power every time, escalating to achieve your GSA (see <i><strong>Defining your strategy</strong></i> section above)</li>
  <li><strong>Allow people to contribute in their own way. </strong>Enable supporters to contribute to your cause / tactics / strategy in whatever way they feel comfortable. You might be willing to chain yourself to a tree to save it, but others might prefer to organise a theatre play to create more awareness about the importance of not cutting trees.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Saul Alinsky's 13 Rules</h2>
<p>In his oft-cited book <a href="https://activisthandbook.org/en/rules-for-radicals"><i>Rules for Radicals</i></a>, Saul Alinsky includes a chapter on tactics containing 13 rules for choosing your tactics.</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.” (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Never go outside the experience of your people." (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Wherever possible go outside of the experience of the enemy.” (p.127)</li>
  <li>“Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“A good tactic is one that your people enjoy” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose.” (p.128)</li>
  <li>“The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>"“If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counter side; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative.” (p.129)</li>
  <li>“The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” (p.130)</li>
  <li>"“Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” (p.130)</li>
</ol>
