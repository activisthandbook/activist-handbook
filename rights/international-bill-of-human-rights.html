<ul>
  <li>Created by the UN</li>
  <li>How influential it is is debated</li>
  <li>Confusingly, the International Bill of Human Rights is actually not a bill at all, but includes a resolution and two treaties: the <a href="/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), the <a href="/en/International-Covenant-on-Civil-and-Political-Rights">International Covenant on on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The first two are super relevant to activists but the last one is not, so we won't talk about it. Since it is not a bill,<strong> the ‘Bill’ is</strong> <strong>not legally binding</strong>. However, this doesn't mean that it's unimportant.</li>
  <li><strong>These rights apply to every single human being</strong>, regardless of nationality or any other bullshit category the state puts you in.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 2)&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>From a legal perspective, our states have to provide a way for us to address violations of the ICCPR. This means that if you believe an authority has violated this part of the International Bill of Human Rights, you can hold them accountable for this. Of course, states don’t always follow this obligation, and the documents contain a number of exeptions such as “public emergency” that allow states to break these rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a more abstract perspective, human rights arguably have influence due to their status as an ‘international norm’. They are widely accepted as legitimate, which means they influence what is regarded as acceptable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it like democracy: even the most undemocratic regimes in the world pretend to be democratic ('Democratic People's Republic of Korea', anyone?). Human rights are treated in a similar way; politicians and states generally don't want to be known for human rights abuses - among their own citizens or the wider world. We, dear activist, can use this to our advantage.</p>
<h2>Criticisms</h2>
<p>There are a number of legitimate concerns about the Bill of Rights, even beyond the fact it’s non-binding. Firstly, its language is astonishingly non-inclusive, with the documents regularly using the male pronoun “he” when supposedly talking about human beings in general. Secondly, there is a great deal of concern that they are western-centric or eurocentric (<a href="https://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/25/western-human-rights-in-a-diverse-world-cultural-suppression-or-relativism/">anon 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309673496_Are_the_concepts_of_human_rights_western-centric_euro-centric_or_'universalizable'"><u>Pandey 2016</u></a>; <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13169/reorient.4.1.0059?seq=1"><u>Saghaye-Biria 2018)</u></a>, with many experts and activists arguing they were created by western countries to solve western problems, ignoring the existence of other cultures.</p>
<h1>Your rights</h1>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">X</mark></p>
<h2>The right to do activism?</h2>
<h3>Freedom of opinion and expression</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<strong>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression</strong>; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 19)&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What this means</strong><br>You can hold and express opinions without being punished for doing so. If your government limits your freedom of expression, you can tell the world that they’re breaking human rights law. For example, this could include censoring individuals within your movement or banning a certain social media platform for the population.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>The government can limit your expression if they consider it to be “propaganda for war”. This is obviously open to abuse, so be aware that if a government wants to stop you expressing yourself they are likely to label it as war propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant documents</strong><br>Both rights are contained in the UDHR, and Freedom of expression is also in the ICCPR.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Assembly</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association."</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 20)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What this means</strong><br>You have the right to join other individuals in a public place and express your ideas. This should mean governments cannot ban protests.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>Governments can suppress freedom of assembly to protect national security, public safety, public order, public health, morals, and the rights and freedoms of others (Article 21, ICCPR). This gives the government a lot of reasons to stop you assembling, so check out your national law to understand how this is interpreted in your country.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant documents</strong><br>This right is contained in both the UDHR and ICCPR.</p>
<h3>Freedom of association</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 22)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What this means</strong><br>You have the right to join a collection of other individuals in an organisation that is aimed at protecting your interests, such as a trade union.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>This is limited in precisely same way as “freedom of assembly”, which means that your national context is also extremely important.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant documents</strong><br>This right is contained in the ICCPR.</p>
<h4>Political participation</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity…</p>
  <p>(a) To take part in the conduct of <strong>public affairs</strong>...</p>
  <p>(b) To vote and to be elected at <strong>genuine periodic elections</strong>…</p>
  <p>(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to<strong> public service</strong> in his country.”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 25)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What this means</strong><br>You have the right to elect people and be elected. The article quoted above specifies that this includes everyone being allowed to vote anonymously and on equal terms.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>There are no restrictions placed on this right.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant documents</strong><br>This right is contained in the ICCPR.</p>
<h2>Rights in relation to the authorities</h2>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">X</mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>These are rights that…&nbsp;</li>
  <li>This includes the authorities of your city, country, workplace, or wherever you're organising.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to privacy</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary <strong>interference with his privacy</strong>, family, home or correspondence”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What this means</strong><br>If the authorities spy on you, you can tell the world that they're breaking human rights law. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>There are no restrictions placed on this right.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant documents</strong><br>This right is contained in both the UDHR and the ICCPR.</p>
