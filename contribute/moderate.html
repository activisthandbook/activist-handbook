<p>Moderators uphold quality by proofreading, adding references and fixing vandalism. You can help!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Quick actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://activism.rocks/vandalism"><strong>Report vandalism</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Help us respond quickly to vandalism. Report it and we'll fix it ASAP.</li>
    <li><a href="http://activism.rocks/review"><strong>Request a review</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Wrote something yourself and want someone to read it over? We're happy to help you out.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how you can start moderating:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://activism.rocks/join"><strong>Sign up</strong></a><strong> and join our Slack.</strong></li>
  <li>You'll now receive an invite link to join our Slack workspace. Join the channel #moderation.</li>
  <li>Every time someone edits the website, requests a review or reports vandalism, it will be reported in that channel. In some cases, you may need to <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">request the necessary permissions</a> before you can edit our website.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Transparency</h1>
<p>In principle, we allow anyone to contribute to our shared knowledge base on activism. However, everyone who wishes to do so, must follow <a href="/en/about/principles">our principles</a>.</p>
<p>Any changes made are saved forever. We do this to provide transparency about who has contributed to Activist Handbook.</p>
