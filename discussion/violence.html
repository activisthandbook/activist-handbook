<p><strong>Main question:</strong> In what way should we discuss the use of violence by activists?</p>
<p><strong>Final answer:</strong> This discussion is still ongoing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>This is a discussion page. </strong>We encourage the use of the comment section to exchange arguments. Please keep it civilised and stick to our <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/about/principles">principles</a>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that arguments made by individual contributors do not necessarily reflect the position of Activist Handbook. Discussion pages serve as a way to ensure we define our principles in a transparent and democratic manner. In addition, we organise video calls to have more personal and dynamic conversations about the discussion topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There are many definitions of what 'violence' entails.</li>
  <li>Various forms of violence are illegal in large parts of the world, which could have implications for the legality of Activist Handbook's content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some possible answers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We should not discuss violence at all.</li>
  <li>We discuss how violence is being used by activists. However, we clearly condemn the use of violence.</li>
  <li>We discuss how violence is being used by activists. We show all sides of the debate.</li>
  <li>It should be allowed to discuss violent tactics, without any disclaimers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concrete examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In our references, we currently refer to <i>The Anarchist Cookbook </i>by<i> </i>William Powell, a book which "provides instructions for making bombs, drugs, and operating firearms" (<a href="https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/anarchist-cookbook">Davis, 2019</a>). Should we allow referencing to resources that provide instructions for violent tactics?</li>
</ul>
