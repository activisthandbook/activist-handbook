<p>This page contains a list of various tactics that activists use to make change happen. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to the cause in their own way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the tactics below require you to assemble many people. Make sure to check out our chapter about <a href="/collective-action"><strong>collective action</strong></a> to find out more about this topic.</p>

<h1>Choosing your tactics</h1>
<p><i>This section was based on the chapter 'Using your power' in </i><a href="https://advocatesforyouth.org/youth-activist-toolkit/"><i>Youth Activist Toolkit</i></a><i>, by Advocates for Youth (2019)</i></p>
<p>Here are some quick steps to help you decide what tactics to use:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make clear what change you would like to see. </strong>You are calling upon others to do something, so make sure they know what exactly you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Get the attention of your targets. </strong>Who are affected? Who might support your cause? Who has to power to decide on the issue?</li>
  <li><strong>Use your power and act collectively. </strong>Whatever you do, do it together with others. The harsh truth: you will probably not achieve your goal after a single action, so make sure to build your power every time.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow people to contribute in their own way. </strong>Enable supporters to contribute to your cause in whatever way they feel comfortable. You might be willing to chain yourself to a tree to save it, but others might prefer to organise a theatre play to create more awareness about the importance of not cutting trees.</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>Protests</strong></h1>
<p><a href="/tactics/protests"><strong>Protesting</strong></a> is great way to attract the attention of the public, either by gathering a large crowd or by doing something out of the ordinary.</p>
