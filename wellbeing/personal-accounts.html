  <p>This article needs to be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>⚠️ Please clarify the purpose of the page, otherwise it may be deleted. </strong>While we very much value the personal experiences of activists, we try to organise all our pages based on topic, so that other activists can more easily find the information they are looking for. For example, someone who has experienced a burnout, may add their story to a page about burnouts. The purpose of this page seems to be to collect any personal account, which would create a completely unorganised list. Consider adding sections to other articles about the personal experiences of other activists instead.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Record your personal experiences! They can be anonymous or signed. Please limit to one experience per person for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be as emotional and expressive as you want!</strong> In the future we may archive voice recordings of activists here. Get in touch if you can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose an experience that means a lot to you, <strong>positive or negative</strong>, and please avoid naming other individuals.</p>
<p>If you want to record a more detailed case study of a specific case of activism (actions, strategies, organisational methods etc) for scientific / strategy-building reasons, please use the <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/strategy/case-studies"><strong>case studies pages</strong></a> instead.</p>
<p>Use the quotations format for personal accounts.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>‘OMG! I just had the most amazing experience with the Coalition for Sustainable Stuffed Toys! We did a big recycled materials stuffed-toy workshop right outside a chain toy-store and blocked people from entering the toy store. I was scared but one of the security guards asked if he could have one of the stuffed toys for his daughter. It was magic!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‘I have a sick feeling in my stomach whenever I think about the Revolutionary People’s Front for Pizza. They claim to support people who like all kinds of pizza, but I was laughed at when I said I liked baked beans on my pizza. I'm never doing activism again'.</p>
