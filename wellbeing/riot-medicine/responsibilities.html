<p>Medics make up the autonomous part of the healthcare system that attends actions and interfaces with the organizations and individuals involved in protest and civil unrest. Even during the least confrontational actions, participants may need medical assistance. Hot weather can make people ill, and fascists may make surprise attacks against participants. As the level of violence increases, police repression can make it increasingly risky for protesters to use traditional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (1),so social movements must provide their own medical care.</p>
<p>While rare, life-threatening injuries require immediate attention, and survival rates drop with each additional minute before aid arrives. Medics who are on scene can administer lifesaving interventions until the patient can be brought to advanced medical care. In some cases, advanced medical care may be delayed by large crowds, road blocks, or malicious police obstruction; or it may not be available at all.</p>
<p>The term “propaganda of the deed” is often assumed to refer to violence alone, but it means so much more. By helping each other, we encourage others to do the same. In a 2007 essay, the Aftershock Action Alliance described such direct challenges to the State as “insurrectionary mutual aid.”4</p>

At times, police road blocks prevented patients from getting to hospitals at all. Medics set up two hotlines, one for physical trauma and one for emotional trauma, to help medical professionals to provide aid to protesters.</i></p>

The week Heather Heyer died, I had exclusive interviews with medics who said state police forced them to stop working on her after the crash — which they believed led to her death. The piece was canceled by my employer at the time, but I’ll never forget what those medics told me. 2019-08. url: https://twitter.com/MaryEmilyOHara/status/1161031331213533184 (visited on 2019-09-01).</li>
