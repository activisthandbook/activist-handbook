<p>Here are some tips to write good articles:</p><ul><li><strong>Texts should be simple to read.</strong> Many visitors of this site are non-native English speakers. Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones. You can also add translations for your own native language!</li><li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic, and make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li><li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you. You can start writing an article, which others can finish.</li><li><strong>Make it accessible for everyone. </strong>Make sure to provide an alternative title for pictures so that people with screen readers know what is shown too.</li><li><strong>Make it look engaging: </strong>Add some illustrations, pictures and videos.</li></ul><h1>Template page structure&nbsp;</h1><p>Every article should contain the following (in this order):</p><ol><li><strong>Title: </strong>The title should be short and clearly describe what the page is about. It should clearly distinguish it from other pages. It cannot be a sentence or question.</li><li><strong>Subtitle: </strong>The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engines optimisation, it also has to be relevant for website visitors.</li><li><strong>Short introduction. </strong>The introduction should:<ul><li>Explain what the page is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader.</li><li>Outline the contents of the page.</li><li>Encourage people to contribute to the page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Subtopics (bullet list):</strong> If there are any subtopics of the page, make sure to add a list directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".</li><li><strong>Contents: </strong>Make sure to structure the contents using titles.</li><li><strong>Related articles (bullet list): </strong>To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter. They should not be subtopics (as those are already in the 'subtopic' section).</li><li><strong>References to external resources (bullet list):</strong> Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li></ol><h1>Style guide</h1><p>Use <mark class="marker-yellow">highlights</mark> only to encourage people to start contributing to our platform.</p><blockquote><p>Use block quotes for quotes that are 40 words or more.</p></blockquote><p>To subdivide an article with titles, first use the <strong>Heading 1</strong>. Subsections of particular parts are marked with <strong>Heading 2</strong>, and so forth.</p><p>Make links <a href="#style-guide"><strong>bold</strong></a> if they are an important part of the page. For example: do not make links to external resources bold, unless the page's main aim is to help people find external resources.</p>
