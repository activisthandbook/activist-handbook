<p>If you want to achieve social change, it is advisable to think about how you are going to organise yourself in the long term. In many cases, you will not achieve your goal after a single protest. Sometimes movements grow very fast and lose focus. Setting up a proper organisation will help you to work more effectively and prevent future problems.</p>
