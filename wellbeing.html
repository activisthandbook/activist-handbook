You might feel disappointed with yourself for not doing enough, or you feel helpless because others are not doing enough. You might fear being infiltrated by police or oppositional activists groups, and are not sure anymore who to trust.</p><p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>You can contribute: </strong>Whatever your experiences as activist are, they are valid and deserve to be heard.
