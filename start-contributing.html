<p>Activist Handbook is written by activists like you. We are building this knowledge base together. You can start contributing too by <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/register"><strong>creating an account</strong></a>!</p><h1>How to write a good article</h1><p>Here are some tips to write good articles:</p><ul><li><strong>Texts should be simple to read.</strong> Many visitors of this site are non-native English speakers. Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones. You can also add translations for your own native language!</li><li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic. </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li><li><strong>Make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li><li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you. You can start writing an article, which others can finish.</li><li><strong>Make it accessible for everyone. </strong>Make sure to provide an alternative title for pictures so that people with screen readers know what is shown too.</li></ul><h1>Moderation</h1><p>Every edit is saved forever. This makes it easier for us to moderate. Currently, it is not yet possible to view version history of pages on our website, but you can access our backup at <a href="https://github.com/activisthandbook/articles">GitHub</a>.</p>
