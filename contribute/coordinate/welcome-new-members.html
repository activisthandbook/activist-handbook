<h1><strong>Welcome emails</strong></h1>
<p>To save time, we <strong>automatically</strong> send a welcome email to new members using Mailchimp automations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First email: confirmation</h2>
<p>Immediately after someone signs up, we send the following email:</p>

  <p><strong>We'll reach out to you soon. To make sure we can get you in touch with the right coordinator, make sure to fill in <u>this form</u>.</strong></p>
