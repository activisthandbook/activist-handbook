<h1>How to edit a page</h1>
<p>Anyone can edit pages on Activist Handbook. All edits are saved. This makes it easier for moderators to prevent vandalism and creates transparency about who added what information.</p>
<p>To edit a page, click the blue <strong>Edit</strong> button in the bottom right corner. Our visual editor will now appear. Use the menu bar on the top of the screen to style the text. We also have a more elaborate guide on <a href="@">how to style and format articles</a> on Activist Handbook. Once you are done editing, make sure to click the green <strong>Save</strong> button in the top right. To close the visual editor, click the red <strong>Close </strong>button in the top right.</p>
<h2>Solving a save conflict</h2>
<p>When multiple people are editing the same page simultaneously, the visual editor will will give an orange warning in the top right. A problem might arise &nbsp;once one of the people saves their edits, after which another person saves their own edits, causing the first person's edits to be overwritten.</p>
<p>Luckily, all edits are saved in the <a href="#">version history</a>. When you notice your edits are being overwritten, just copy your contributions from the version history and save the page again.</p>

<h1>How to move a page</h1>
<p>Pages on Activist Handbook are organised in folders. They can only exist in one place at the same time. However, it is possible to create a redirect link.</p>
<p>Here is how to change the page url or put the page in a different folder: First, open the page you would like to move. Then click the blue <strong>Edit</strong> button in the bottom right corner. On the top right, click the <strong>Page</strong> button with the blue label icon. This will open up a window where you can change various page properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To edit the page url, change the <strong>Path </strong>field. Remember: paths should not contain any special characters such as "!@#%" or spaces. Alternatively, you can also click the <strong>Folder </strong>button with the looking glass, to browse and select a folder. Do not forget to close the window by clicking <strong>Ok</strong> and then the <strong>Save</strong> button with the green checkmark in the top right corner.</p>
<h1>How to delete a page</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>You need to be a <strong>moderator</strong> or <strong>administrator</strong> in order to be able to delete a page. If you accidentally created a page which should be deleted, send us a message: <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">contact@activisthandbook.org</a></p>
