<p>We like to be as transparent as possible about how we develop our platform, making it easier for activist developers to start contributing to our project. On this page we document what tools we use and why.</p><p><mark class="marker-yellow">We only recommend tools we actually use and like. Affiliation links are always clearly marked.</mark></p><h1>Website</h1><p>The Activist Handbook platform is running <a href="https://wiki.js.org">WikiJS</a>. We bought our domain name at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>. Our website is hosted using a droplet with automatic weekly backups by <a href="https://m.do.co/c/853123d09510">DigitalOcean</a> for $6 per month <i>(affiliate link: you get €100, we get €25)</i>. We use the free version of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> to protect our site. We backup our articles using GitHub. Check out this <a href="https://docs.requarks.io/storage/git">guide</a> how to set up Git versioning in WikiJS.</p><h1>Email</h1><p>We wanted an email setup that would cost as little as possible while still remaining reliable. Verification emails when signing up are send using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a>, for which we have a free limit of 62,000 emails per month with a rate of 14 emails/second.&nbsp;</p><p>We receive emails using Google Suite. There is also a plan for non-profits, but since we are not yet an officially registered foundation, we cannot apply for it.</p>
