<p><b>Activist Handbook is like the Wikipedia for activists, and you can help us build it. Join our movement by signing up below!</b></p>
<p>We are writing a digital handbook for activists. But it is not just any handbook. Anyone can contribute, you too! Saw an interesting article or documentary? Add it. Are you bilingual? Help us by translating one of our articles.</p>
<p>We need artists, lawyers, doctors, students and everyone else wants to make this world a better place. No matter if you have experience with activism or not, you can join us!</p>

<h1>We need to act now</h1>
<p>These are frighting times. We are heading for a climate catastrophe. Yet, our political leaders continue to fund the fossil industry with millions of dollars. But we are not powerless! We can still fix this. If we start organising, mobilising and let our voices be heard, we can shift the tide.</p>
<p>We are a Activist Handbook. We educate those who are brave enough to challenge the status quo. We believe thereâ€™s no one who can stop us, once we unite and act as one.</p>
