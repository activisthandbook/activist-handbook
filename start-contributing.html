Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones. You can also add translations for your own native language!</li><li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic. </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work.</li><li><strong>Make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li><li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you. You can start writing an article, which others can finish.</li><li><strong>Make it accessible for everyone. </strong>Make sure to provide an alternative title for pictures so that people with screen readers know what is shown too.</li></ul><figure class="image"><img src="/login-register.png"><figcaption>Login or register by clicking the button in the top right</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="/edit.png"><figcaption>Edit the page by clicking the red button in the bottom right</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="/choose-language.png"><figcaption>Choose the language of the page you are viewing by clicking the globe in the top menu bar.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="/edit-text-style.png"><figcaption>Change the text style with the options in the top menu bar.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="/edit-metadata.png"><figcaption>Edit the page name, description, tags and path by clicking the blue button in the top menu bar.</figcaption></figure><h1>Get to know us</h1><p>We would very much like to get to know you!
