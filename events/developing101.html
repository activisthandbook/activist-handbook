<p>We will start with a short introduction round to get to know each other. To share this page, use this short link: <a href="http://activism.rocks/101">http://activism.rocks/101</a></p>
<h1>Basic concepts</h1>
<h2><strong>Front-end</strong> versus <strong>back-end</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Front-end: </strong>client (the browser) versus server</li>
  <li><strong>Back-end:</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Front-end languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML: </strong>With HTML, you write the structure of the web page, using different blocks. It's like lego!</li>
  <li><strong>CSS: </strong>With CSS, you style a web page. It's like painting your lego!</li>
  <li><strong>Javascript: </strong>Used to make your web page <i>do</i> all sorts of stuff. You will write logic such as ‚Äòif X is equal to 18, then do something‚Äô. I'm not sure how to apply the lego analogy here‚Ä¶ üòÖ</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be lazy, use tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Don't know something? </strong>Someone has already written down the answer. You just need to find it. Use Google, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a></li>
  <li><strong>Editor: </strong>Just like when writing a paper in Word, there are apps for writing code. You can use apps like Visual Studio Code or Atom.</li>
  <li><strong>Package managers: </strong>Developers are lazy. We don't like writing code. So we use code that others have written<i> a lot</i>. Package managers are like app stores but for code. You download a piece of code that you need using the package manager.</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries: </strong>When building many apps, you will find there are parts of code you want to have available every time. Libraries are basically bundles of code that you can import in your own app, so that you don't have to write them yourself over and over.</li>
  <li><strong>Frameworks: </strong>Frameworks are similar to libraries. But instead of importing a small piece of code, frameworks are meant to be used as a blueprint for your app. We will be using a Javascript framework called VueJS.</li>
</ul>
<p>This quote might help you understand the difference between libraries and frameworks:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúA library is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You don‚Äôt feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.</p>
  <p>A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few <i>limited</i> choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.‚Äù</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>The command promt/terminal&nbsp;</h2>
<p><i>Also called: shell, console</i></p>
<p>The command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac) is the scary thing you see in movies. You use commands to let your computer do basically anything (really <i>anything</i>, please don't accidentally delete all your folders).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frequently used commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type <code>dir MyFolder</code> (Windows) or <code>cd MyFolder</code> (Mac) to navigate folders. To go up one folder type <code>cd ..</code> (two dots).</li>
  <li>Type <code>mkdir MyNewFolder</code> followed to create a folder</li>
</ul>
<h1>Installing prerequisites</h1>
<h2>Visual Studio Code&nbsp;</h2>
<p><i>An editor for programming languages</i></p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download"><strong>Download Visual Studio Code</strong></a></p>
<h2>Node</h2>
<p><i>Javascript runtime environment (for running Javascript on your computer, outside your browser)</i></p>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"><strong>Download Node</strong></a></p>
<h2>NPM</h2>
<p><i>A package manager</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm"><strong>Read how to install NPM</strong></a></p>
<h2>VueJS Framework</h2>
<p><i>The Javascript framework that we will be using today</i></p>
<p><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html"><strong>Read how to install the Vue Client</strong></a></p>
<h1><strong>Developing your first web app</strong></h1>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create"><strong>Create a new Vue project </strong></a>using the Vue Client.</li>
  <li>Open the graphical user interface by running <code>vue ui</code> in your command prompt/terminal. The GUI itself is also a web app, so it will open in your browser!</li>
  <li>Use the graphical user interface to serve your new project, or <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create">use the command prompt/terminal </a>by running <code>vue serve</code> in your project folder.</li>
  <li>Open the folder with your code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code).</li>
</ol>
