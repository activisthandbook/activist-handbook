<h2>What is it and does it matter?</h2>
<p>Confusingly, the International Bill of Human Rights is actually not a bill at all, but includes a resolution and two treaties: the <a href="/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), the <a href="/en/International-Covenant-on-Civil-and-Political-Rights">International Covenant on on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The first two are super relevant to activists but the last one is not, so we won't talk about it. Since it is not a bill,<strong> the ‘Bill’ is</strong> <strong>not legally binding</strong>. However, this doesn't mean that it's unimportant.</p>
<p>From a legal perspective, our states have to provide a way for us to address violations of the ICCPR. This means that if you believe an authority has violated this part of the International Bill of Human Rights, you can hold them accountable for this. Of course, states don’t always follow this obligation, and the documents contain a number of exeptions such as “public emergency” that allow states to break these rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a more abstract perspective, human rights arguably have influence due to their status as an ‘international norm’. They are widely accepted as legitimate, which means they influence what is regarded as acceptable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it like democracy: even the most undemocratic regimes in the world pretend to be democratic ('Democratic People's Republic of Korea', anyone?). Human rights are treated in a similar way; politicians and states generally don't want to be known for human rights abuses - among their own citizens or the wider world. We, dear activist, can use this to our advantage.</p>
<p>The International Bill of Human Rights applies to every single human being, regardless of nationality or any other bullshit category the state puts you in.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind”</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i> (Article 2)&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Concerns</h2>
<p>There are a number of legitimate concerns about the Bill of Rights, even beyond the fact it’s non-binding. Firstly, its language is astonishingly non-inclusive, with the documents regularly using the male pronoun “he” when supposedly talking about human beings in general. Secondly, there is a great deal of concern that they are western-centric or eurocentric (<a href="https://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/25/western-human-rights-in-a-diverse-world-cultural-suppression-or-relativism/">anon 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309673496_Are_the_concepts_of_human_rights_western-centric_euro-centric_or_'universalizable'"><u>Pandey 2016</u></a>; <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13169/reorient.4.1.0059?seq=1"><u>Saghaye-Biria 2018)</u></a>, with many experts and activists arguing they were created by western countries to solve western problems, ignoring the existence of other cultures.</p>
